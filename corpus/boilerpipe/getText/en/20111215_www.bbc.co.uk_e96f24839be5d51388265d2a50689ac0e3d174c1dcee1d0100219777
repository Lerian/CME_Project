A quarter of young women 'have had sex under age'
The proportion of girls having under-age sex has risen significantly
More than a quarter of women now aged 16-24 first had sex when they were under age, compared with just 4% of women aged 55-69, a survey suggests.
The Health Survey for England asked 8,420 adults aged 16-69 about a range of issues, including sexual behaviour.
For men, the rise in under-age sex was smaller - from 15% of 55- to 69-year-olds to 22% of 16- to 24-year-olds.
Sexual health experts said young people needed education to ensure they did not have sex before they were ready.
The survey was carried out by the NHS Information Centre.
It also found that a significant number of the current generation of young people had never had sex - 26% of women and 32% of men.
This compared with 1% of 55-69-year olds, and 2% of 25- to 55-year-olds.
By contrast, one in 10 16- to 24-year-olds - both men and women - said they had had 10 or more sexual partners.
'Dramatic change'
NHS Information Centre chief executive Tim Straughan said: "The survey paints a picture of sexual behaviour which is changing over the generations, with younger women beginning to have sex younger.
