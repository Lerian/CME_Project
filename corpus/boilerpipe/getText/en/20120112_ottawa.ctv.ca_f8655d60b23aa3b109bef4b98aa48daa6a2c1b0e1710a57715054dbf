More people are diagnosed with cancer in Ottawa than the rest of Ontario, whileÂ fewer people die from it.
Those finding were released in a City of Ottawa report Monday, using data from 2007.
It said there were 3,890 diagnosed cases of cancer that year, with levels of melanoma also "significantly higher" than the rest of the province.
However, Ottawa's levels of prostate and cervical cancer were significantly lower than Ontario as a whole.
Ottawa lost 1,554 people to cancer in 2007, making its levels of mortality lower than the rate for Ontario.
The report said the most common types of cancers in Ottawa were breast, lung, prostate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
