<p>Fine. Have your so called "fun". But just wait until you are older. Trust me, there is a high probability you'll revise your thoughts and have regrets. I know so many women in this position.</p>

<p>I've been with my boyfriend now for 6 years, and I first had sex with him when I was 15. Am I a disgrace to this country also?</p>

<p>"If the men have 9.3 partners who are they sleeping with if the women only sleep with 4.7?? - Anon, UK,"------------->>> I wish someone would explain the maths involved in this. To me it's a bit like Eve having had just one partner, but Adam having two. - John C, Rotherham S.Yorks"</p>
<p>Around 80% of women sleep around with only 20% of men (the alpha males).</p>

<p>What's the point of the legal age being 16 when you are being taught at school that it's ok as long as you practice safe sex. Nothing about love, respect, serious relationships or more importantly abstinence! Oh and something needs to be done about BOYS, too! Girls can't be the only ones responsible for resisting pressure you know. </p>

<p>If everyone waited until mariage before having sex a LOT of problems with our society would be eliminated. Sex is not just about having a good time--it is far more valuable than that. It is a gift for marriage between two people for the purpose of procreation. It is now demeaned, cheapened and trashed and look what kind of country we have as a result. In fact, have a look at the left column on this page and you see what kind of country we have. </p>

<p>Too many UK girls and women are fine with becoming little more than a notch on some thugs bedpost and nothing more than a "hole" to be used to get his rocks off on. Well done feminism and "liberation".- Me, Here, 15/12/2011 18:01--------never experienced the female orgasm then???how sad.....</p>
