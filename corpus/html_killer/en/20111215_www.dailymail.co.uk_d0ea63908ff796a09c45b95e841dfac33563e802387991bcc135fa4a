<p>Encourage your husband to eat lots of Marmite on toast for breakfast next summer, disbelief, midlands. Biting insects like mosquitoes, midges etc. hate the smell of Marmite coming through the pores of our skin. The other solution is to buy some Jungle Formula Extra Strength insect repellent. I don't know if Marmite works on bed bugs though as I've never met a bed bug in my life. They were pretty well eradicated here back in the 'Forties with the use of DDT but now they are coming back in force owing to the rise in international travel, they hitch a lift in luggage bags or on people's clothing and so they are most often found living in hotels. </p>
