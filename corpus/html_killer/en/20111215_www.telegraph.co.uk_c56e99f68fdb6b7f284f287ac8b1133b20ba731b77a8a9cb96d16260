<p> Common faults that mean men miss the mark included watching too much sport and poor personal grooming. </p>
<p>Bathroom habits such as leaving the toilet door open were also cited by women taking part in the survey as a frequent failing. </p>
<p>The poll of 2,000 women showed more than 75 per cent believed the perfect man did not exist. </p>
<p>Other shortcomings were an inability to multi-task, criticising their partner's driving and not getting along with her family. </p>
<p>Nikki McReynolds, marketing director for Remington which commissioned the research, said: "It seems that women are actually quite realistic on what they look for from their partner. </p>
<p> "While they might happily overlook a few common flaws from their guys, there are certain behaviours that men just won't get away with." </p>
<p>The results showed one in five women think their partner only pretends to listen to them while leaving clothes on the bedroom floor and snoring were among other gripes. </p>
<p>The perfect man would be expected to make an effort with his partner's friends, avoid using her toothbrush, stay clean-shaven and not be lazy. </p>
<p>But above all, 35 per cent of women rate a good personality as most important with sense of humour the top quality for a quarter of respondents. </p>
<p>Footballer David Beckham came top in the poll of perfect celebrity man, while chef Gordon Ramsay ranked near the bottom. </p>
<p>Miss McReynolds added: "It's clear that while guys may not be completely perfect, there are plenty of things they can be perfect in, in order to please their partner. </p>
<p> "As long as guys take the time to look after themselves, be attentive and keep up appearances then their partner will be willing to overlook the smaller pet peeves. </p>
<p> "The average guy may not be able to compete with the image of a David Beckham, and their partners don't expect them to but there are still a number of small changes they can do to make a big difference." </p>
