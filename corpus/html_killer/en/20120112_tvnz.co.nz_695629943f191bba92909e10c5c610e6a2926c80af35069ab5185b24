<h>Cosmetic surgery reviewed after botched implants</h>Published: 9:58AM Thursday January 12, 2012 Source: Reuters</p>
<p>Britain said today it would investigate whether tighterregulation of the cosmetic surgery industry was needed after ahealth scare over breast implants made by a now defunct Frenchcompany.</p>
<p>Health Secretary Andrew Lansley also ordered a review into thesafety and quality of private clinics offering cosmetic surgery inBritain.</p>
<p>The government has been under pressure to act after an uproar inBritain over breast implants made by Poly Implant Prothese (PIP),which went bankrupt in 2010.</p>
<p>"I have set out today a number of actions to ensure we learn thelessons and look at how we can tighten up regulation of the widercosmetic industry so that this doesn't happen again," Lansley saidin a statement.</p>
<p>The French government has advised 30,000 women in France whobought implants from PIP to have them removed after concerns sincethe death from cancer of a French woman carrying PIP implants.</p>
<p>The British government says there is no need for the routineremoval of PIP breast implants but says concerned women given theimplants through the state-funded National Health Service (NHS)could have them removed and replaced at NHS expense.</p>
<p>Lansley told parliament health minister Frederick Howe he wouldcarry out a rapid study of the use of PIP breast implants inBritain to draw lessons for future regulation.</p>
<p>He said he had asked Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, tolook into health safeguards for people seeking cosmetic surgerysuch as breast implants and wrinkle-smoothing treatments.</p>
<p>AdvertisementKeogh's review will look at whether there needs to be betterregulation of cosmetic products and surgery in Britain and Europeand whether patients "can be confident that the people who carryout procedures have the skills to do so", Lansley said.</p>
<p>The review will also look at record keeping, Lansley said,saying the implant affair had shown safety information the industrycollected was of variable quality. "Without good data, we have noway of knowing when problems arise," he said.</p>
<p>About 300,000 PIP implants were sold worldwide before the firmwent out of business after an official probe revealed it was usinga cheaper unapproved industrial-grade silicone in someproducts.</p>
<p>A British review found no link between the implants and cancer,but had not been able to establish if the PIP implants were morelikely to rupture than others, saying information from the industryto the regulator was patchy.</p>
