<p>We are all designed to have a little stress in our lives ( not too much however). It's not only in the workplace that this can happen , many people go down hill after retirement , and turn to comfort eating or alcohol. If you are in this situation find new hobbies and exersise your brain too. </p>

<p>I am now on the sick with work related stress and anxiety, suffering panic attacks driving to work etc. I am not a workshy person, but one of those who thrive on 'positive stress and pressure' and strive to do my best, but am restricted by new work procedures which have been established by persons who do not understand how action in one area of work reflects on other areas!! ------------------I was exactly the same 15 years ago. I left in the end and temped until something else came up. That job was definitely not good for my health. I too had panic attacks on way to work. I used to think, 'if the lights stay green I'll go in. If they turn red I'll go home'. Seems mad now but I was so unhappy. Used to spend Sunday's counting hours til Monday morning. </p>

<p>Too right! Being bored, undervalued, management not wanting you to use your experience of over 25yrs , etc changed my job from being so so rewarding and interesting where one could immerse oneself, into a job that is so boring and totally unrewarding. My job has actually not changed, but procedures within the work area have drastically altered, and not for the better for our customers. A positive workplace can put external problems out of your mind for some of the say. A negative workplace makes external problems grow. This has happened with me. After over 25 yrs of employment, I am now on the sick with work related stress and anxiety, suffering panic attacks driving to work etc. I am not a workshy person, but one of those who thrive on 'positive stress and pressure' and strive to do my best, but am restricted by new work procedures which have been established by persons who do not understand how action in one area of work reflects on other areas!! </p>

<p>It is a medical condition called "bore out" similar to "burn out". Check out the wikipedia article on it.</p>

<p>I'm never bored at work. My job keeps me comfortably busy from 08.30 to 16.30. The work I do is rewarding and I like the people I work with. I'm a civil servant :-)</p>
