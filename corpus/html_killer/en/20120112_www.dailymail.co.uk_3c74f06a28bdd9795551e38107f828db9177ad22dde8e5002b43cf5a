<p> Faulty: Major clinics fitted the cut price PIP implants, pictured, to make more money, but now they are trying to deflect blame onto the Government</p>
<p> Promise: Andrew Lansley has said that any woman who had the implants on the NHS would be entitled to have them removed for nothing</p>
<p> Outrageous: Nigel Mercer attacked Linia for their comments and said that patients would soon assume clinics were putting profits ahead of their safety</p>

<p> View allThe Government really needs to step up the pressure on these clinics and name and shame.It's not acceptable for women to have products inside them which are not fit for purpose and potentially toxic. Furthermore it's not an adequate response to request that they wait around for the timebomb to rupture before taking any action.The government should be pushing these negligent clinics for immediate preventative action to benefit both the affected women and NHS who will no doubt have to clean up the mess in the future.</p>

<p>If these companies don't soon wise up and remove and/or replace these implants for these women they aren't going to have a business due to the bad publicity they are getting. Or is this what they want? Then the stretched NHS via the taxpayer will have to pick up the bill. And then they can start up another business under another name!</p>

<p>The NHS is already being asked by patients to remove these implants because the private clinics won't pay. It is happening now! Anxious women won't wait while the companies are sued. This shouldn't be happening. The clinics MUST pay. The government needs to step up to the mark on this otherwise it is going to cost the NHS millions!</p>

<p>SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper. My point is that this has nothing to do with the NHS. These clinics should replace them where necessary</p>

<p>I work in the private surgical and non surgical industry and am aware of the company that supplied PIP implants initially. These implants were 'significantly' cheaper than all other implants and I am sure than quite a few clinics/surgeons did not pass on that discount to the patient. I also know that all implants have a shelf life and most patients are advised that they will probably need replacing at around 12-15 years anyway. I am afraid I am of the opinion that if you can afford this kind of surgery to begin with and you are no doubt aware that another op will be required in the furture, then you can afford to have them re-done yourself if you feel you are worried. Otherwise a sensible course of action woudl be to stick to having them scanned regularly to make sure they don't rupture. If they are causing problems then the clinic should replace free of charge regarding. This should have absolutely NOTHING to do with the NHS.</p>
