<p> Researchers say irritability linked to breastfeeding is natural, and not a sign of stress or even hunger </p>
<p> A crying baby may simply be seeking the comfort and closeness of its mother, researchers say</p>

<p>I don't care how many 'experts' say bottle feeding is best, it isn't. Breast is best there is no argument, it is tailor made for a baby and to say otherwise is just plain stupid. If you breast feed your baby they will not be fussy eaters as they have had a 'taste' of all the food you eat via breast milk. Bottle feeding is being pushed becuse it fits in with working women and breast feeding doesn't, it's just another ruse to keep women as wage slaves when they should be at home feeding and looking after their children themselves. Also bottle formula is made from soy which is toxic to babies "most serious problem with soy formula is the presence of phytoestrogens or isoflavones. While many claims have been made about the health benefits of these estrogen-like compounds, animal studies indicate that they are powerful endocrine disrupters that alter growth patterns and cause sterility." </p>

<p>We need research on the impact of mothers' diet on the quality and nutrient levels of breast milk. Such a study could help doctors and dieticians advise mothers on dietary matters to enhance the benefits of breast milk. It could also challenge the findings of this study which maybe erroneously explains away babies' irritability as an attempt to bond. It could be that a nutritionally inadequate diet produces poor quality breastmilk and the poor grizzling babies are in fact malnourished. </p>

<p>Stu, Laholm, Sweden, 11/1/2012 13:35....I was joking when I asked if your successful (and, I hope, happy and healthy) daughter was breastfed. Also, maybe I was not clear, but my paediatrician's advice was the SAME as your daughter's which is that the gap between formula and breastmilk has closed in nutritional terms. Obviously formula cannot offer the same double immunity that a baby gets from breastmilk and yes, there are health benefits to the mother from breastfeeding, but these have to be balanced with the negative effects of stress, lack of sleep and a hungry unhappy (potentially malnourished) baby when breastfeeding does not work out. As long as people are making informed choices it really is not anyone else's business how they respond to their particular circumstances and choose to feed their baby.</p>

<p>Huh! Up at nearly 1am quite some parent!! Don't worry my taxes towards your family allowance will sort you out!! - The Average DiM reader..., Gullible- Second home owner- Ghastly,....If only your taxes covered my family allowance. But in the real world Im a higher rate taxpayer, so MY family allowance is more a MINI Tax Rebate: one which is being withdrawn as of April 2013. </p>

<p>Hacienda Girl - I hope your ignorance isnt passed on to your child! Not everyone can breast feed - that's why wet nurses used to exist and why formula was invented in the first place! </p>

<p>"So it's very easy to say I wasn't producing enough milk!!! Or it's embarrassing to feed in public!? Excuses that too many women make. Be honest and say you DON'T want to feed but don't lie and make up things!!!! "- Doherty967, Doherty, 11/1/2012 19:53My milk never came in(OH MY LORD, I JUST MADE AN EXCUSE!!!!!)...really, not any of it (which was heartbreaking as I did want to breastfeed and I did try)...so of course I should've just let my child starve rather than feed her formula! I say do what you are comfortable with and know that not breastfeeding doesn't make you a bad mom, just like breastfeeding doesn't automatically make you a good mom.</p>

<p>Hear, hear Some common sense at last. I bottle fed both my children who at the ages of 10 and 7 have barely had a days illness between them and were both fantastic sleepers. I hate smug breastfeeding mothers who think that they are superior to mothers who choose to bottle feed.</p>

<p>"And for those of you who complain that Midwifes 'force' you to breastfeed, remember they are health professionals and it their job to 'Promote Health' BREAST IS BEST!"- Doherty967,...Midwives and health visitors only know about infant nutrition what they are told by the scientific community - they are nurses who deliver babies, not nutritionists or researchers. If parents don't want to breastfeed, they should be able to say so without fear of being lectured or castigated by a nurse.</p>

<p>I didn't breast feed either of my two children, I didn't feel comfortable doing it and it was my choice not to. I'm fed up of being told I'm a bad Mother. I have nothing against people breastfeeding but it should always be the Mother's choice without being pressurised.</p>
