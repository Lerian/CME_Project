<p>Rubbish. EU laws do not demand that people are given a job even if they can't speak the language of the country they are in. If the level of English is too low, then we only have ourselves to blame. The EU Working Time Directive also has nothing to do with language.</p>

<p>It's unbelievable how long this is taking to sort out. The EU is like a stupid communist system, and the europhiles have the nerve to say it's a needed thing.</p>

<p>When I work I have to carry and produce my Gas Safe registration ID card to my clients and customers before I even see their gas appliance. Why is it generaly accepted that the "Doctor" you will see, doesn't have to carry similar documentation? When I meet a new GP in our surgery, I can't resist just giving them a small interview prior to letting them loose on my most precious possession, ie. my body.People just take it for granted that because they have Dr at the start of their name that they are experienced and suitably qualified. My requests to doctors for their professional development information does actually take them aback and leaves them surprised and feeling awkward, but hey, if it's okay for my customers to ask for my competence on gas appliances, then I see no reason why this shouldn't apply to these people in the medical profession. Lets have a level playing field here shall we?</p>

<p>And these are the Doctors and Nurses who are going to be "talking" to British patients every half hour, assuming the patients are still alive that is!?</p>

<p>I've seen both sides of this problem. Many years ago I had a doctor release me from hospital because I questioned his nurse about what he had been saying; he was Chinese and didn't like the 'loss of face' that offends his culture. But I've just come out of hospital where the Eastern European consultant surgeon could not have been nicer, kinder or more understanding of my fears, with an excellent command of theEnglish language. On the ward, there were three nurses out of seven who had English as their mother-tongue, others were French, Asian, Pakistani and Spanish. All of them did a brilliant job. Sadly, the NHS would fall further down the drain if it weren't for foreign nationals working in it, but there should be more safeguards in place to make sure that more people have an experience more akin to my latter than my former one.</p>

<p>If they are incompetent and cant speak English why are they allowed to work in the NHS in the first place... Its not them that is putting patience lives at risk its the people that employ them..</p>
