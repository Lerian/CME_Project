<p> View allWhat is it with these people ? Obesity isn't a disease. It is caused by people being greedy and lazy. PERIOD Try eating less and exercising more. It works wonders and is totally free and has no side effects.</p>

<p>With any other addiction you can go cold turkey. People who are binge eaters are always going to struggle because you need to eat for survival so you can't leave your temptation alone. You don't just have to eat junkfood to get fat and most overweight people are not stupid about nutrition. Would you be telling a heroin addict to use willpower? For most people with the media's twisted view of how we should look, weight is a difficult issue.</p>

<p>Even if you ignore the side effects, it doesn't seem to be worth taking the hormone due to the very long time it would take to lose the weight. Weight loss is available in many forms, I'm a Cambridge Weight Plan consultant so see many overweight people. I have helped many people who have lost 2 to 14 stones plus. The main problem they, and I find is that it is difficult to keep off. They have now found that we have diminished levels of hormones, leptin and grehlin, that make us permanently hungry because our bodies behave like its underweight although we are not. This is still the case after 5 YEARS! If leptin and grehlin could be given to these now thin people they would not put weight back on. In the meanwhile, I get all my Losers to hit the Gym, initially to tone, secondly to increase metabolism through building muscle, as it's muscle that burns calories. For the normal people, Its not rocket science, calories in + calories burned etc. see you in the gym and don't leave it too long.</p>

<p>There is natural appetite suppressant available for FREE every day, it's called FAT. A high fat low carb diet keeps appetite under control. It will also cure diabetes 2 without need for drugs with unpleasant side effects.</p>

<p>There are already appetite suppressants at health food shops and gyms! Although I've yet to come across any that don't make you feel sick!</p>

<p>Wow, link between an individuals appetite Rating 7Report abuse</p>
<p>But for the FEW with severe medical reasons, eating less, cooking at home, managing your portion size and cutting out excessive booze and fast food could cure the obesity crisis too and no nasty side effects or huge costs to anyone else. But that would be too simple and what excuse would all the 'I'm just big boned' or 'I can't help it' (rare that's ever really the case but my support to the ones who really do suffer) people do? </p>

<p>Since when has it anything to do with appetite? People eat because they like the taste of something, not because of hunger.</p>
