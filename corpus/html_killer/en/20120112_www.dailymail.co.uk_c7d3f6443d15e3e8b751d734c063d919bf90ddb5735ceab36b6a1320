<p> View allSurely this will make any future clients run a mile before entering this clinic? Should these women also worry about what they have been injecting in their faces too, especially all the trout pout women on tv these days???</p>

<p>When you buy goods or services they must be "fit for purpose". Therefore if these are not then under the Sale of Goods and Services Act the supplier is responsible to put right or refund - if a refund is made on the cost then that money should go to the NHS if they put things right! The taxpayer should NOT, except where the work was originally carried out by the NHS, have to foot the bill! </p>

<p>so if there was no NHS to fall back on what would happen could you afford to sue them or would they just go out of business .this is the all singing all dancing private medical care we are running headlong into,we have seen what happens in the private care home industry,no profit no service.</p>

<p>And the tax payer can't afford to correct their mistakes either. They took the profit they should fix the problem.</p>

<p>Anybody who has any procedures booked at these clinics should cancel them now until the clinic accepts its responsibility and does the right thing by replacing the implants. They made enough money out of putting them in so they can bear the brunt. They must have insurance surely.</p>

<p>What a complete joke!!! the health n safety rules only apply when it is costing honest hard working people....who is responsible for this total mess up of health n safety needs shooting!! Huge profits have been made in this growing industry and now they need to give it back, they dont want to play ball. I would say they have killed their own golden goose now...</p>

<p>Interesting isn't it that whilst the French health service have offered to take these implants out, the British goverment have said they will only consent to the removal if your private clinic refuses to carry out the op.What happens about the reconstruction I wonder? Good move by BMI to offer. Their positive attitude has bought them effectively thousands of pounds worth of free advertising and makes them look like they care.; effectively BMI's stance forced the government to take the default position and do something about the PIP implants. .</p>

<p>Yet again private business takes the profits when things are going well but expects the public sector to pick up the bill when things go wrong. THIS IS NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE NHS!! The Harley Medical Group is clearly not fit for purpose and should be closed down as a matter of urgency. Its assets (including the homes of its directors) should be sold to cover some of the cost of rectifying their incompetence. </p>

<p>What they really mean is "it will cut into our profits, so we'll let the NHS cope with problems" That is what happens with MOST private health-care facilities in the UK, who will not do ANY medical procedures that do not make them a profit_ the difficult cases are ALL referred on to NHS facilities. </p>
