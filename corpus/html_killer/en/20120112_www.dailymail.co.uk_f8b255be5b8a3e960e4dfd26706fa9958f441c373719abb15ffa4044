<p> An electron micrograph of prostatic cancer cells. A new drug prolonging life for prostate cancer sufferers has been rejected by the NHS rationing body</p>
<p> Owen Sharp, from the Prostate Cancer Charity, said the news is a 'huge blow' for those in the advanced stage of the disease</p>

<p> View allLet's be clear - this is not a cure. If this drug were able to cure the cancer then I am sure it would be found to be good value. But at a cost of over £7000 per month for the extra 3 months it provides? I can see why Nice have felt the need to make this decision. What good is an extra 3 months to most people. This includes my father, who has the time of cancer they describe, currently controlled by hormone treatment, and who when the time comes will, I am sure, move on to the next line of treatment if the benefits outweigh the side-effects, but he would not wish to deprive the country of £22k for a mere 3 months at the end of his life. A cure would be a different matter entirely.</p>

<p>The National Health Service is NOT the National Immortality Service. The price of this drug is ridiculous and unaffordable.</p>

<p>Stop the idea of taking out breast implants of woman who chose to have them to enhance their bodies, stop sex changes, IVF and for goodness sake help those that are ILL. Start charging overseas visitors for their healthcare when taken ill in Britain, for goodness sake the NHS is so poorly run by tree hugging ineffective managers they need to be fired. </p>

<p>Don't worry about it. Be happy knowing this government can afford £33,000,000 to spend on a pointless railway line. Well done Dave, that's priorities for you...</p>

<p>I'm sure the poor men suffering with this terrible disease, through no fault of their own, can console themselves with the thought that the vacuous bimbos who borrowed off their credit cards to have their mammaries enlarged by private clinics, and who now claim that they can't afford to pay to have them removed, will be treated free of charge by the NHS. Ain't Britain great?</p>

<p>Sadly what people do not realise is that the NHS needs all the money it can get for s8x change operations and br8ast enlargements.</p>

<p>The NHS is misandrist, has been for years. Go into any surgery and check out the posters on the walls. Can you find one which deals with male issues? Go into a hospital. Can you find a male nurse? Ask at your local surgery for a blood test. See how they will um and ah about it. Then send your wife in a few days later and see how they will immediately give her an appointment.I hope I live long enough to see the worm turn. Should be fun to watch!</p>

<p>It does not matter to MP's and those in high pay as £22000 is something they will just pay to extend their life if needed, It is Joe public that cannot afford it. The average is 3 months meaning that some will live longer and presumably during the trial the worst affected would have been treated and if now considered safe and given earlier we will see longer survival rates. NICE must go.</p>
