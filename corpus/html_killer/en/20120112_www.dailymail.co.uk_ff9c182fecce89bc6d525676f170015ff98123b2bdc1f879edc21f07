<p> View allMy 9yr old started school in 2006 and has always had a named inhaler with a clear prescription label kept in the school office, along with a spacer device and a medical form completed by me. This has allowed her to have supervised inhaler doses whilst at infant school with minimal fuss. The schools in question are supportive and helpful. Reading this article makes me appreciate their efforts and their policies even more.</p>

<p>I think asthma is the least of the worries for the kid in the picture.</p>

<p>These are the lives that are lost due to the 'elf and safety' zealots. It's all well and good trying to minimise risk but when you look at the bigger picture what you have actually done is minimise one risk slightly but increased another risk massively. You can't eliminate all risk from life, just unecessary risk.</p>

<p>I am a teacher. Legally I am not qualified to administer medication to a child but when I take children on field trips I wouldn't dream of not having a blue inhaler in my first aid kit. Side effects from ventolin are extremely rare, while deaths of teenagers from asthma are sadly not so rare. If there is time of course I would leave it to the paramedics, but if an ambulance could not get to us in time I'd far rather risk professional or legal consequences than watch a child die. Usually an asthmatic child carries an inhaler with them, but teenagers being what they are I'd rather be safe than sorry, especially if we happen to be halfway up a mountain or miles from anywhere.</p>

<p>In most of the schools I know the children have their inhaler kept either by the teacher in a locked desk or in a locked cupboard in the office. Spares are named and kept in the office for safety, but the school cannot keep spare prescription medication un-named "just in case a child does not have his inhaler that day". It is up to the parent to ensure a named spare is kept at school. It is NOT the school's job. The result of a child being given unsuitable medication by a supply teacher or temporary lunchtime supervisor is an horrendous thought.</p>

<p>A simple pouch attatched to a belt with the inhaler in it is all that mum has to supply, like the holiday bum bag. And yes I do suffer from Asthmamyself.</p>

<p>If their attitude to asthmatics is the same as to diabetics, then god help those kids. Anyway, the fact that there are 1,100 deaths a year is surely enough to prompt a rethink on this issue. How about a school nurse on the premises? Too simple? Probably.</p>

<p>what ever happened to the school nurse a lot of children would not be sent home is there was a qualified nurse at the school to give the children their medication they need when they need it.</p>
