<p> He has received conventional treatment, including seven rounds of chemotherapy. Doctors were pleased with his progress but Gibb decided to seek other ways of recovery.</p>
<p> Bee Gees star Robin Gibb has flown in a team of alternative medics from Switzerland as he battles liver cancer, British newspaper reported.</p>
<p> It is claimed the group is on hand to help Gibb 24 hours a day. The naturopath nutritionists encourage him to eat foods that are good for the body so it is as strong as possible as he fights the disease.</p>
<p> The star's wife Dwina reportedly asked her husband to speak to the professionals as she is a big believer in natural medication.</p>
<p> It is believed Gibb, 62, has also been spending time in a special detox hut where he sweats and loses toxins.</p>
<p> Robin is fighting this with dignity and courage. He's trying everything possible to beat this disease, an insider said.</p>
<p> Gibb's diagnosis was first reported in November and came after the musician was seen looking increasingly frail in public.</p>
<p> Soon after his diagnosis was reported, Gibb posted a message on his website reassuring fans he was doing well. I have been very unwell and am now on the road to recovery, and your prayers and wishes are a great tonic to me, he wrote.</p>
<p> I believe because of you I will get well and my deepest love goes out to you all. </p>
