<h> Shopping for way to break cigs habit </h>

<p> Published on </p>
<p> HEALTH experts are meeting South Tyneside shoppers as part of a drive to get smokers to quit the habit.</p>
<p> NHS South of Tyne and Wear has organised a stop smoking roadshow to tour the region, which includes various dates in the borough.</p>
<p>Staff will man stands, and will be able to refer people wishing to quit to their local stop smoking services at community pharmacies, on the spot. </p>
<p>They can also give out information on stopping smoking and arrange to contact those people who go away with information to signpost them to services at a later date. Pam Lee, public health consultant for South Tyneside PCT, said: “Stopping smoking is the single greatest thing you can do to improve your health. </p>
<p>“With the help of the NHS Stop Smoking Service, you are four times more likely to quit than using willpower alone.” </p>
<p>The road show will be visiting Tesco in Newcastle Road, Simonside, South Shields, today, tomorrow, January 27 and 28, and February 2 to 4. It will also be at Asda in Coronation Street, South Shields, tomorrow and Saturday, as well as January 27 and 28 and February 17 and 18.</p>
