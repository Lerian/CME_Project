<h>Advocates want free booze for alcoholics</h>
<p>Published: Jan. 11, 2012 at 11:27 AM</p>
<p> Comments Email Print Listen The proposal is from Vancouver's Eastside Illicit Drinkers Group for Education, which was formed in July and received a $52,000 grant to research alcohol maintenance programs in British Columbia.</p>
<p>Spokesman Rob Morgan said he is among thousands of alcoholics who buy and drink hand sanitizer stolen from hospitals, and also drink mouthwash or rubbing alcohol, The (Vancouver) Province reported.</p>
<p>Vancouver already has centers where heroin addicts can inject with safe syringes and Morgan said the time has come to give the same protection to alcoholics,</p>
<p>"It would be members-only because once word gets out it is free alcohol everyone that just wants a free drink would show up," he told the newspaper.</p>
<p>Preliminary estimates show it would cost about $350 per month per drinker, but the group maintains that would be cheaper than the costs of emergency medical treatment for people drinking unsafe alcohol.</p>
<p>A proposed drinker's lounge would be stocked with vodka, sherry and high-alcohol beer, Morgan said.</p>
