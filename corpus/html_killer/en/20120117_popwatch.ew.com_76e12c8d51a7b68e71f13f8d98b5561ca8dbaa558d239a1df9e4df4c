<p>by Jeff Labrecque Categories: Food and Drink, Television Paula Deen, the Southern-style cook whose drawl is as rich as some of her dishes, has Type 2 diabetes. She made the announcement yesterday in a release for her new Diabetes in a New Light website and products.</p>
<p>This morning on , the Food Network star admitted to Al Roker she learned of her diagnosis during a routine check-up three years ago but decided not to take that news public until she could bring something to the table when I came forward. </p>
<p>Deen, whose menu has been criticized by other celebrity chefs for being unhealthy, insisted to Roker that she always encouraged moderation when it comes to diet, including her own.</p>

<p>Is the sad news that Deen has diabetes complicated in your mind by the fact that she s now a paid spokesperson for a pharmaceutical company? Did she have any responsibility to share the news of her illness with her loyal foodies sooner?</p>
