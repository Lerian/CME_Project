<h>Effective law to deal with wall chalking suggested</h>
<p>January 16, 2012 RECORDER REPORT 0 Comments Administrator KMC Muhammad Hussain Syed has said that an effective law to deal with the major problem of graffiti (wall chalking) had been suggested so that those who indulged in mutilating the city's face could be awarded with strict punishment.</p>
<p>He said this while talking about the cleanliness, beautification and wall chalking in the city, according to a Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) statement on Sunday.</p>
<p>Administrator Karachi said it was decided in a meeting chaired by the Sindh Governor to bring in such a law under which the persons involved in wall chalking on residential houses and buildings could be charged with non-bailable offence and punished.</p>
<p>Draft for this law has already been prepared.</p>
<p>He said KMC often carries out campaigns for removal of the chalking on walls and ban on such activity was enforced under Section 144 Cr.</p>

<p>He said the district municipal administrations were already directed to clean the graffiti, so that these ugly blots on the face of city could be removed.</p>
