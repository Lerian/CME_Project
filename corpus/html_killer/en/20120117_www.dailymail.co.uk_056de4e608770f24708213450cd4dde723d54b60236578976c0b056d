<p>Now those idiots will blame it on "computer error" when it was humans who programmed in that mistake in the first place !!Didn't *ANYONE* test the program and check the results *BEFORE* it was delivered to the users ?? What about the users ?? Did they do a User Acceptance Test (UAT) *BEFORE* deploying the program live ??Now, that poor computer is going to get the blame !!</p>
