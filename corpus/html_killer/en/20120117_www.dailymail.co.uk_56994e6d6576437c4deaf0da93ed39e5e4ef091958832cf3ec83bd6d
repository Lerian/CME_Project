<p> View allGiven that there is still demand for it, I take it that the 2 miracle wrinkle cures by Lanc√¥me that so many people had pre-ordered last summmer didn't work then, huh?</p>

<p>5,000 mugs have been fooled into registering for a product based on 44 women (88% of 50) who were given the stuff for free then had their feedback massaged by some marketing woman at L'Oreal/YSL? 5,000 women need they heads testing!</p>

<p>Eat healthily, keep your skin hydrated and stay out of the sun and use cheap face creams from Aldi. . . . - Linda, Fife, 16/1/2012 17:24 = = = = = = = = Yes, correct. Plenty of fruit and veg, loads of water (at least 1 litre a day), and may I add, plenty of SLEEP (and a good work/life/family balance if you can). Avoid alcohol and ciggies which wreck the skin. Also, Body Shop Vitamin E range is excellent. Forget serums and use a good facial oil with rose or with lavender (Kiehl). Sanctuary (get in Boots stores) does a marvellous facial oil.</p>

<p>I have worked for YSL beauty for 11 years, and let me tell you something...YSL is owned by Loreal as does lancome and armani cosmetics...all of these 'luxurious' products are made at the same place as the cheaper stuffwhen we went for our training, the trainer said herself this is rubbish, so your job is to convince people that these products really are working. so if u have lots of money and dont know what to do with it, then go ahead and buy these stuff, otherwise dont trow your money away!</p>

<p>If only the money spent on research to stop wrinkles was spent to find a cure for the terrible genetic skin disease that killed little Tripp Roth ( in today's newspaper), then the world would be a much saner and more beautiful place.</p>

<p>Ladies, you might as well hand your money over to a snake oil salesman. Eat healthily, keep your skin hydrated and stay out of the sun and use cheap face creams from Aldi. It's a lot cheaper.</p>
