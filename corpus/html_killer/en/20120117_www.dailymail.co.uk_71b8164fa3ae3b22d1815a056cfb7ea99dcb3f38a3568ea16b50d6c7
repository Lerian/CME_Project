<p> View allMore to the point, could this be used to fix blood vessels with damaged valves that cause vascular reflux and varicose veins? That's a life-long misery that often enough leads to chronic chronic venous insufficiency, open sores on the legs and weight gain from enforced inactivity ... which of course ultimately adds to the list of people with heart issues. I'd really like to see somebody figure out how to fix that, and save healthcare all over the world a ton of money at so many levels, as well as make people's lives so much better.</p>

<p>Haha! I love how I post a truthful comment here and I am attacked by ignorant people with no sense of reality. Grouse, heart attacks are up because more people eat more meat and dairy and high-fat. Fat causes heart attacks as it sticks to the insides of arteries thus clogging them. High-carb vegan diet prevents heart attacks; just ask Dr. Esselstyn - or Google his name. By the way, carbs from fruit do not make one fat; fat makes one fat, meat makes one fat. Obese people are not on diets of fruits and vegetables. Obese people eat meat and dairy. Lindsey, was your father on a raw diet of fruits and vegetables? Was his fat intake Click to rate Rating 13Report abuse</p>
<p>Ah, more medical genius's here on the Mail's medical articles. Just like the scientific genius's who appear on the science stories.I just wonder, if you have answers to so many medical problems, often in a few short, pithy sentences, why you restrict yourself to the comments columns in a newspaper.Why aren't you out there putting your genius into action?</p>

<p>What a load of tosh Pacificus! My father suffered a large heart attack 4 months ago followed by a blood clot in his artery 2 months later and he is 55 and "low risk", not over weight, not diabetic, low blood pressure, always led an active life (used to scramble) always eat sensibly but his dad died of a heart attack at almost the same age, sometimes its genetic or just plain bad luck. So get down off your high horse and I hope you never have to suffer the pain or worry or having a loved one go through this!</p>

<p>What a waste of time and effort. In order to prevent heart attacks and strokes simply eat a high-carb, low-fat plant based diet. Avoid meat and dairy. It's easy.- Pacificus, Peterborough, UK, 16/1/2012 04:44====So, explain to me please why, since the introduction of high-carb, low-fat plant based diets and avoiding meat and dairy, the number of heart attacks and strokes has INCREASED? </p>
