<p>By Daily Mail Reporter</p>
<p>Last updated at 2:16 PM on 17th January 2012</p>
<p> Tamiflu was prescribed on a mass scale in 2009 following the nationwide outbreak of swineflu</p>
<p> Cochrane Collaboration founder Sir Iain Chalmers said Tamiflu makers Roche 'refused to provide data'</p>
<p> Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche said they 'stand by the robustness and integrity of our data'</p>

<p> View allAnd everyone ran out to get their hands on this DRUG because we were all going to die of bird flu. When countries didn't want it BIG PHARMA tried to offload it to smaller countries for less cash so that they could make their money BACK. Check out RECOMBINOMICS. Bird is breaking out in Egypt with all sorts of combos H1N1/H3N2/H5N1. Seems very suspicious if you ask me. Notice there is nothing in the news about these outbreaks in other countries. That's because big pharma knows that people over here aren't falling for the hype and have wizened up. Nowadays the big push is to get all girls VACCINATED for the human papillomavirus. Read about the side effects. Next they'll have a vaccination for smokers/fat people/ugly people/etc.. Where does it all stop? NO MORE VACCINES!</p>

<p>What a load of bull, the big pharmas are making a fortune out of us, prescribing everything for nothing, a lot of ailments could be aided by change of food intake and exercise, but we all rather run to the doic for a quick fix, its up to us as a nation to stop taking the poills and start to look after ourselves in a much healthier life style,</p>

<p>SCAM!!! This was just another set of lies to spread fear to the masses. News headlines were all saying millions were going to die and so on. Utter garbage. It was a total con-job and the politicians, health dept. and the big pharma representatives that were part of this should be held accountable and jailed for wasting MILLIONS of tax-payers money. Of course the good-old-boys club will all stick together and nothing will happen. Sickening.</p>
