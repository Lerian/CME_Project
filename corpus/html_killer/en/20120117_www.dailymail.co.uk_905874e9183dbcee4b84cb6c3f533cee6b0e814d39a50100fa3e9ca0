<p> Early detection key: If caught early, the cancerous cells can be zapped with an electric current which kills them without surgery</p>
<p> Deadly: Oesophageal cancer is one of the most fatal because it is often missed or wrongly diagnosed until it is too late</p>

<p> View allI may not be a 'Cambridge Don' but this says it is not a cure but a way of detecting it. If people die from the treatment rather than cancer, like you say, early detection will avoid a lot of the treatment.</p>

<p>I am the first to acknowledge that Cancer is a vile and pernicious disease but rather than get all emotional, stick my head in the sand and pretend it's not happening I prefer to obtain the optimum amount of knowledge about the 'enemy' I must confront. Drug companies are amoral. Instead of trusting somebody that is going to earn money by doing something to your body, the very least you owe yourself, is to research thoroughly. G Edward Griffin's "A World Without Cancer" is a great place to start. It's freely available on-line; you have nothing to lose other than your life. I'll give you a couple of facts. Firstly, the drug companies have NOT come up with ONE SINGLE CURE for Cancer in over One-hundred years - absolutely 'zilch'. More importantly; the majority of Cancer-deaths are as a direct result of the TREATMENT. I deal in TRUTH, unpalatable as it may be, and if I am able to encourage just one single person to pursue a CURE, I will happily face the 'Slings and Arrows'.</p>

<p>More 'snake-oil' which the gullible will be queuing up to obtain. And £Millions more in profits for Big-Pharma who laugh all the way to the bank.- The Cambridge Don, Cambridge------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------One could get into a long argument with someone like yourself making the kind of inflammatory satatements you are making. You could try and argue a rebuke to your accusations. But then it just becomes a pointless debate.In reality, of course 'Big Pharma' that you cite, are far from perfect.Yes, they put profits first. Of course they do. Yes, they like to produce products that will have the biggest market possible. But they are companies, not charities. And yes, there are side effects from some drugs. Old and new.But if you add up the benefits, the longer lives, the lives free of pain and suffering, against the negatives, the net result of 'Big Phama', is very much a positive.</p>

<p>Cambridge Don, please give it a rest. I know many people who have been cured by those methods and remain cancer free 10, 15, 20 years later. Although I agree with your sentiments re : "Big Pharma". However, back to the subject at hand, my mother was diagnosed with this awful cancer far too late, rendering any further treatment futile. Had she not been treated for "indigestion" for 18 months and had been referred for investigations instead, she may have lived to tell the tale. Therefore, I welcome this development as this particular cancer is notoriously difficult to detect because the symptoms mimic so many minor conditions. Early diagnosis is the key.</p>

<p>hope is given to all the people who suffer from this, hope is also given to people that perhaps we may be able to conquer this. Hope could turn into reality and a major step forward- keep researching who knows they may be able to conquer this.</p>

<p>More 'snake-oil' which the gullible will be queuing up to obtain. And £Millions more in profits for Big-Pharma who laugh all the way to the bank. The Cancer Industry has not come up with a single cure in over one hundred years. Their expertise is in their ability to demonize cures that exist in Nature. How on earth can anybody with even the tiniest bit of common-sense believe that they can be 'cured' through burning, cutting and poisoning their bodies? Those troubled with this disease should, instead of clutching at straws, watch G Edward Griffin's "A World Without Cancer". They will then be in a better position to make an informed choice. Get healthy and stay healthy - make Big-Pharma bankrupt.</p>
