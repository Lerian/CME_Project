<p>Vitamin D is made from cholesterol, so maybe this low cholesterol nonsense plays a part in these diseases too.</p>

<p>DM, will you please stipulate - in all your reports on this essential vitamin - which form of vitamin is being referred to: D3 is the one to mention, not D2, as the former is the one the body produces from sunlight, and is much more effective than D2. Rule of thumb: if D3 is NOT specifically mentioned as a supplement, assume it's D2, and avoid. 2000 - 5000IU (50 to 125 micrograms) daily especially in winter, and lower in summer, depending on how much sunlight falls directly on the skin between 10am - 2pm, for about 15 mins. The more the skin is exposed, like on a beach, the less time required. </p>
