<h> Sponsored by Norovirus closes five wards at L D spokesperson said: “The L D has several cases of winter vomiting disease (norovirus). In order to protect our patients, and members of the public, we are closing hospital wards to all visitors (with some exceptions).</p>
<p>“Additionally we are asking the public only to come to A E if it is a real emergency, and if people do need to come to A E please don’t bring the whole family - just one person to accompany the patient.</p>
<p>“These measures are necessary to protect our patients and public from the highly contagious norovirus which causes projectile vomiting and uncontrollable diarrhoea.”</p>
<p>The ban on visitors is expected to last for 24-48 hours. </p>
<p>The spokesperson said if members of the public think they may have winter vomiting disease, they should not go to A E as there is no treatment for this virus, it needs to run its course over two or three days. </p>
<p>The best advice is stay indoors, isolate yourself from other people and drink lots of water to keep rehydrated. </p>
