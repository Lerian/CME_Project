<h> Inquest starts into baby s hospital death </h>

<p> Tama Galiere died on June 25, 2008, after he was admitted to Sydney Children's Hospital.</p>
<p> How does a 10-month-old otherwise healthy child go into hospital and not survive? counsel assisting the coroner, Sergeant Sheldon Koreluk, said in her opening statement today.</p>
<p>Tama visited a doctor in February 2008 for an infection in his left eye and was taken to hospital on June 10, where he was given antibiotics intravenously during a 10-day stay.</p>
<p>His mother Karamia Wheaton took him home from hospital on June 20 but he had to be re-admitted the next day when the eye infection returned.</p>
<p>A catheter was inserted into his arm on June 23 but he died two nights later from inflammation of the heart, Glebe Coroners Court was told.</p>
<p>Ms Wheaton said she watched her son get increasingly ill.</p>
<p> He was white as a ghost and I knew straight away something was wrong, she told the inquest as she fought back tears.</p>
<p>Only a short time earlier she had waited up to 15 minutes to get a doctor after her son's lips had turned blue.</p>
<p>He had also vomited over his grandmother who had flown into Sydney from New Zealand.</p>
<p> He was turning his head from side to side like he was having a nightmare, Ms Wheaton said.</p>
<p> He was still. He wasn't moving. He was getting cold. </p>
<p>Ms Wheaton told the inquest that she had not been told of the risks of the treatment used on Tama, who was given a Maori name meaning boy.</p>
<p>Tama's father and Ms Wheaton held hands during the inquest, which continues before deputy state coroner Scott Mitchell.</p>
