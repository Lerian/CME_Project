<p> A disabled businessman has been thrown off a budget flight because he could not walk to the emergency exit.</p>
<p> EasyJet staff told Dr Martin Sabry, 39, who is paralysed from the chest down, that he could not travel on his own.</p>
<p> He said ground control told him he could board the plane, but the captain over-ruled the decision and he was told all single passengers must be able to reach the exit.</p>
<p> Advertisement >> Dr Sabry says he often flies for work and had never had this issue. He said yesterday: It was so demeaning and unbelievable the way they treated me and the purser was obnoxiously rude. </p>
<p> Dr Sabry, from Cambridge, waited four hours to speak to bosses, who apologised, put him on the next flight from Gatwick to Toulouse and paid for his taxi transfer.</p>
<p> A spokeswoman said: All passengers travelling alone must be able to make their way to an exit unaided it seems there was a misunderstanding regarding this. </p>
