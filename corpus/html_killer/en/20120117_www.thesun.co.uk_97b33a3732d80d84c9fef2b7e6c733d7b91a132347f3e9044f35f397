<p>Add a commentForever Youth Liberator from Yves Saint Laurent had already racked up more than 5,000 pre-orders.</p>
<p>In a trial of 50 women, nine out of ten said their skin looked more luminous after using the lotion, while 72 per cent said fine lines were less visible.</p>
<p>The range contains synthetic versions of glycans, naturally occurring sugars in the skin.</p>
<p>Science writer and broadcaster Vivienne Parry says: "Glycobiology is going to change the world in many areas and it is a very important development in skincare too.</p>
<p>"Glycans are complicated sugars that play a key role in the structure of the skin.</p>
<p>"They also sit on the surface of cells and transmit messages to them. Glycans reduce with age. These glycans can make skin cells act as they would have when in a younger body."</p>
<p>A study of the technique in the journal Technology Review in 2003 said the discovery was "one of the ten emerging technologies that would change the world."</p>
<p>YSL worked with Professor Peter Seeberger, of Germany's Max Planck Institute, to develop the serum.</p>
<p>He said: "I was surprised YSL was interested in my work. I'm interested in health, not face paint. Still, we were able to apply our existing techniques to glycans in skin."</p>
<p>But the search for eternal youth is not cheap. Just 30g — just more than two tablespoons of the serum — is .</p>
<p>Skincare wonder products are not new — and often cheaper.</p>
