<p>The tie-up coincides with the discovery inIndiaof what some doctors have described as cases of totally drug-resistant TB,which were not treatable with any available drug.      </p>
<p>TB is caused by mycobacterium tuberculosisand destroys lung tissue, causing victims to cough up the bacterium, which thenspreads through the air and can be inhaled by others.      </p>
<p>“Our cooperation with Aeras includesvaccine design, pre-clinical research, clinical trials, production and sales,”CNBG president Yang Xiaoming told Reuters in a telephone interview. “The idealvaccine should guard against all strains of TB, including drug-resistantstrains.”      </p>
<p>Aeras president and chief executive JimConnolly said both parties would screen through their catalogues and identifythe most promising vaccine candidates, move to pre-clinical studies and thenclinical trials in the next few years.     </p>
<p>“From where we are, to develop a TBvaccine in Chinais going to take at least seven to ten years,” Connolly said. “The cost todevelop vaccines ultimately goes into tens if not hundreds of millions ofdollars, both in direct costs of developing it as well as the costs of all thefailures.”      </p>
<p>Aeras chose to work with China becauseof its significant TB burden and after it identified TB, HIV/AIDS and hepatitisas its top three infectious diseases.     </p>
<p>“They have a very strong emergingtechnical capability and the government has financial resources,” Connollysaid.      </p>
<p>An ancient, long-neglected disease, theworld has had no new vaccines or drugs to fight TB for decades even though itis still a leading killer. In 2010, 8,8 million new cases were reported, with1,45 million deaths from TB worldwide.     </p>
<p>It was not until about 20 years ago thatdrugmakers began paying attention to the disease when it re-emerged in developedcountries in patients whose immune systems were wrecked by AIDS.      </p>
<p>Worse, drug-resistant TB strains haverisen in prevalence, yielding cases that are nearly impossible to treat.      </p>
<p>In India recently, 12 patients inMumbai failed to respond to all first- and second-line drugs such as isoniazid,rifampicin, amikacin, capreomycin, and kanamycin. Manufacturers of TB drugsinclude Eli Lilly Co, Sanofi SA, Johnson Johnson’s JanssenPharmaceuticals, Pfizer Inc, Bayer AG and many producers of generic drugs.      </p>
<p>The only vaccine against tuberculosis isBacillus Calmette-Gu‚rin (BCG), which is 90 years old and the efficacy of whichis in doubt. It works to some degree to protect against serious disease ininfants and babies, but does nothing to protect teenagers and adults among whommost incidents occur.</p>
<p>There are now more than 10 candidatevaccines being developed and trialled.     </p>
<p>Connolly said clinical trials for theircandidate vaccine will include patients from China,India and sub-Saharan Africa, home to most of the world’s TB sufferers.      </p>
<p>“This is not developing vaccines just for China, but alsoto be used in other parts of the world,” he said, adding that the product wouldbe affordable to patients everywhere.     </p>
