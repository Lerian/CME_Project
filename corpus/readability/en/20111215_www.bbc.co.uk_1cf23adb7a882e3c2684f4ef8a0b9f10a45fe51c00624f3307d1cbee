                      <p class="introduction" id="story_continues_1">Obesity, poor diet and excessive drinking are still causing unacceptable levels of ill health in Scotland, its chief medical officer has warned.</p>&#13;
        <p>Dr Harry Burns said Scotland continued to have worse problems than most of its European neighbours, and called for new thinking on tackling the issue.</p>&#13;
        <p>He said deaths from Scotland's "big three" killers - cancer, heart disease and stroke - were continuing to fall.</p>&#13;
        <p>The comments came as Dr Burns <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/365208/0124172.pdf">issued his annual report</a>. </p>&#13;
        <p>The chief medical officer said government action in recent years had cut problems like smoking-related illness, but warned action was still needed in other areas.</p>&#13;
        <p>He pointed to figures from the <a href="http://scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Health/scottish-health-survey">Scottish Health Survey</a> which indicated;</p>&#13;
  <ul>&#13;
    <li> a quarter of Scots ate poorly</li>&#13;
    <li> did not get enough exercise</li>&#13;
    <li> drank too much </li>&#13;
    <li> and were overweight</li>&#13;
  </ul>      <p>His report said: "Obesity, poor diet and excessive alcohol consumption continue to be a cause of unacceptable levels of ill health which are inequitably distributed across society."</p>&#13;
        <p>Dr Burns said evidence suggested Scotland had the eighth highest alcohol consumption rate in the world.</p>&#13;

        <p>Dr Burns also said there had been a "steady increase" in the number of overweight or obese adults between 1995 and 2010, with numbers in the 16-64 age group increasing from 52.4% to 63.3%.</p>&#13;
        <p>In 2010, he added, 22% of adults met the recommended daily intake of five or more portions of fruit and vegetables - a figure which had "not changed significantly over time".</p>&#13;
        <p>However, he also said death rates from the big three among under-75s has fallen by 28% - from 507 per 100,000 people in 1995 to 365 per 100,000 in 2009.</p>&#13;
        <p>And smoking rates among 16 to 65-year-olds fell from 35% in 1995 to 28% in 2010. </p>&#13;
        <p>Dr Burns welcomed the figures, but warned: "Not all sections of society are benefiting at the same rate and, overall, Scotland continues to have a higher level of ill health than most of our immediate neighbours in Europe."</p>&#13;
        <p>The chief medical officer called for a change in dealing with problems, suggesting people and communities could get more involved, taking responsibility for health improvement beyond what it offered by the NHS.</p>&#13;
        <p>He also said: "Health promotion campaigns usually have a positive effect on some people, but often those in most need of changing their behaviour are least likely to take notice of such campaigns."</p>&#13;
