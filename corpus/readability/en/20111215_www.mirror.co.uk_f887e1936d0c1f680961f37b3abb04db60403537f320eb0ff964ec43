	<p>Up to 40 mothers, some accompanied by their partners, descended on Brighton, East Sussex, and breastfed their children in front of Christmas shoppers.</p>&#13;
	<p>The demonstration was organised by an incensed mother after she was criticised by customers in a cafe for breastfeeding one of her daughters last week. </p>&#13;
	<p>Claire Jones-Hughes, 38, was confronted by a group of four middle-aged women and a man in her favourite vegetarian restaurant, Wai Kika Moo Kau, after feeding four-month-old Callie. </p>&#13;

	<p>Mrs Jones-Hughes said: "One woman said, 'It was very unpleasant watching you feed. You should have covered up more.' </p>&#13;
	<p>"When I protested, the others joined in, and the man said, 'You should have used a towel.' </p>&#13;
	<p>"I was really shocked, especially as I'd gone to a lot of effort to be discreet. </p>&#13;
	<p>"You usually get nice comments when you're with a baby, and I couldn't believe I was having this conversation. </p>&#13;
	<p>"In their world, it was completely unnatural that they should see me doing that." </p>&#13;
	<p>Despite the support of another customer, Mrs Jones-Hughes was visibly shaken and reduced to tears by the incident. </p>&#13;
	<p>She said: "After they left, the manager came over to ask what happened and was mortified when I told him. </p>&#13;
	<p>"When I calmed down it reminded me of all the stories I've heard from other women who've had similar experiences." </p>&#13;

	<p>After drumming up support online, Mrs Jones-Hughes encouraged other women to brave the cold to feed their babies as part of the flashmob at the Clock Tower. </p>&#13;
	<p>The customer services manager, who also has a three-year-old daughter Lexie, said she hoped the event would give confidence to mothers who are nervous about breastfeeding in public. </p>&#13;
	<p>She said: "I've had comments from all over the country about how great it is to make a stand. </p>&#13;
	<p>"I've got two daughters who may have children themselves one day. If they choose to breastfeed in the future I'd never want anyone to make them feel how I felt." </p>&#13;
	<p>Local NCT committee member Suzanne Borrell said: "There is an assumption that Brighton is generally seen as a very tolerant, broad-minded community but as this and previous unpleasant episodes show, nowhere is safe from such bigotry." </p>&#13;
	<p>Faruk Bulut, the owner of the cafe in Brighton's Kensington Gardens, said he supported the right of mothers to breastfeed their children where they want. </p>&#13;
	<p>He added: "The restaurant was very busy when the incident happened so I wasn't aware of it until afterwards. </p>&#13;
	<p>"We support the idea that mothers should feel free to feed their babies and we never make it difficult for them. In fact, the cafe is very popular with mothers." </p>&#13;
