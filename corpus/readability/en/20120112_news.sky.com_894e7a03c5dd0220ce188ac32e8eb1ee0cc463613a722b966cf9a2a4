        <h2>The Health Secretary has announced a new review into all cosmetic procedures, including breast implants and dermal fillers.<br/>&#13;
</h2>
<p>It will look at how quality and safety in the industry can be improved and better regulated.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh will lead the review, prompted by concerns clinics are not collecting data properly.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a href="http://indepth.news.sky.com/InDepth/topic/Andrew_Lansley" title="Read more news about Andrew Lansley" target="_blank"><b>Health Secretary Andrew Lansley</b></a> told Sky News the review could open a "Pandora's box" but said he would rather tackle the issue proactively instead of waiting for problems to develop later.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>"I am going to make sure we cast the net widely," he said.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>"This is not just important for us in the wake of the breast implant scandal from France... We want to make it a proactive opportunity to look at safety."</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>He said the move should not be interpreted as an attack on the industry.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>"I hope they will see it... as a real opportunity to get rigorous standard-setting and reporting," Mr Lansley said.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It follows significant fears some silicone implants could be at risk of rupture after French firm Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) was closed down for using materials designed for use in mattresses.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Around 40,000 women in Britain are believed to be affected and many wish to get the silicone removed.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>However, there has been a mixed response from the cosmetic surgery industry. The Harvey Medical Group, for example, has said it will not replace PIP implants free of charge.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In Parliament earlier, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the Government had let down women who feared their implants were unsafe.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Many of those who had the operations privately have struggled to gain access to their medical records, have faced lengthy delays or "hit a brick wall", he said.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Mr Lansley said the NHS would be there for women who find their private clinic refuses to remove faulty implants.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>"Any NHS service in this instance would only cover the removal of the implant, it would not include the replacement of private cosmetic implants," he said.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>"In these cases the Government would pursue private clinics to seek recovery of our costs."</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Mr Lansley said it would not be fair for the taxpayer "to foot the bill" for patients who went private.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When the review into all procedures was announced, Sir Bruce said his priority was to ensure the safety of people who undergo cosmetic surgery.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>"The vast majority of practitioners in the cosmetic industry are professional and well skilled - but I'm concerned that the sector as a whole does not have the systems for monitoring the results for patients and alerting us to possible problems.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>"I will work with the industry to improve regulation and governance and increase consumer confidence," he added.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Market analysts <a href="http://www.mintel.com/" title="Read more about Mintel" target="_blank"><b>Mintel</b></a> estimates that in 2010 there were 101,904 surgical procedures and 1,250,919 non-surgical procedures carried out in the UK.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>But this does not include privately-held "botox parties".</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The same year the market was worth £2.3bn and is expected to grow to £3.6bn in 2015.</p>
