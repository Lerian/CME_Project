<p class="imageCaption">Confused: German-trained doctor Daniel Ubani killed a 70-year-old patient by giving him a tenfold overdose of diamorphine</p></div><p><font>European laws are putting the lives of British patients at risk by allowing incompetent and poorly trained foreign doctors to work in the NHS, two senior doctors warned today.</font></p><p><font>Professor Norman Williams, president of the Royal College of Surgeons and Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians, say 'urgent action' is needed to combat 'huge variations' in the quality and training of foreign doctors.</font></p><p><font>The pair point out that many foreign-trained doctors are given jobs despite barely being able to speak English.</font></p><p><font>The issue resulted in tragic 
consequences in 2008 when David Gray died after he was administered ten 
times the required dose of the painkiller diamorphine by German locum Dr
Daniel Ubani on his first shift in the UK.</font></p>
<p><font>Dr Ubani said he was confused about the difference between drugs used here and in Germany.</font></p><p><font>Almost a third of all doctors working 
within the UK - some 88,000 - are foreign-trained with around 22,758 of 
those coming from within the European Union.</font>
</p><p class="relatedItemsTopBorder"> </p>
<p><font>In a joint letter to the Daily 
Telegraph, Dr Williams and Dr Thompson wrote:'The language competency of
doctors from the EU working in Britain, and the stifling effect of the 
European Working Time Directive on the time that trainee doctors have to
learn on the job need urgent action.</font></p><p><font>'EU
laws that apply to all sectors can have unintended consequences in 
health care that can put patients at risk, whether in Britain or other 
member states.'</font></p><p class="clear"> </p><div class="thinCenter"><p class="imageCaption">Demanding action: Prof Norman Williams, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons (left), and Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians (right), say EU laws are endangering the lives of NHS patients<br/></p></div>
<p class="clear"> </p><p><font>Currently, British health regulators are not automatically warned when a doctor is struck off the medical register in another country.</font></p><p><font>Yesterday, Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said he was already taking action to crack down on doctors with a poor grasp of English from practising within the heath service.</font></p><p><font>He said: 'We agree that for too long patients have been let down by European rules which allowed doctors to operate in the UK.</font></p><p><font>'That's why I announced last year new rules on checking doctors' language skills and new powers to take action against doctors who can't speak English properly.</font></p><p><font>Mr Lansley has pledged to revise the European Working Time Directive law, which limits doctors to working no more than 48 hours a week, and which he claims hinders the NHS's ability to train its staff.</font></p><p><font>According to the Royal College of Surgeons around 400,000 surgical hours are lost annually as a result of the directive.</font></p><p><font>By October next year, Britain will be required to offer treatment to patients from the EU under the recently introduced 'cross-border health care' directive.</font></p><div class="cleared art-ins news"><h3 class="wocc">GERMAN LOCUM WHO KILLED PENSIONER WITH LETHAL INJECTION ON FIRST SHIFT IN UK SPOKE POOR ENGLISH</h3><div class="ins cleared xolcc bdrcc"><p> </p>

<p><font>Pensioner David Gray was suffering from renal colic when he was visited by German locum Dr Daniel Ubani at his home in Manea, Cambridgeshire, on February 16, 2008.</font></p><p><font>Soon after, he was dead.</font></p><p><font>Speaking poor English and confused about the types of drugs used in the UK, Ubani had administered ten times the normal dose of the painkiller diamorphine to the 7o-year-old.</font></p><p><font>A coroner ruled the death 'gross negligence and manslaughter' and described Ubani as incompetent. <br/></font></p><p><font>He said the government must issue guidance to NHS trusts over checking the backgrounds of doctors and their grasp of the English language.</font></p><p><font>Ubani, originally from Nigeria, was struck off the medical register in the UK. <br/></font></p><p><font>He was later fined £6,000 by medical authorities in Germany, but was free to continue working there. </font></p></div></div>
