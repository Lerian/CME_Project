Out of 10.9 million runners, there were 59 instances of cardiac arrest, 42 of them fatal.</p><p>
										
                                        
                                        
                                        More cases of cardiac arrest happened during marathons than half-marathons, and more deaths occurred during marathons. More men than women experienced cardiac arrest, and those who survived the episode tended to be older.</p><p>Researchers were able to get comprehensive clinical information on 31 of the runners who experienced cardiac arrest; among those, 23 died. The most common causes of death were hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and possible hypertrophic cardiomyopahty; that's a condition in which the heart muscle thickens, making it more difficult for the heart to pump blood.</p><p>Among those who survived, ischemic </p><a class="taxInlineTagLink" id="HEDAI0000026" title="Heart Disease" href="/topic/health/diseases-illnesses/heart-disease-HEDAI0000026.topic">heart disease</a><p> was the main cause of cardiac arrest; in that condition, the heart can't pump enough blood to the body, usually because of coronary artery disease.

But the fact that rates went up could mean the sport is attracting more men at higher risk for cardiovascular disease who are running for health benefits.
