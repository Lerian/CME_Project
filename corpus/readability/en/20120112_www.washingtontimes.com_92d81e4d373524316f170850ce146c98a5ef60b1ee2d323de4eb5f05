<html><body><div><div class="story left mb"><p>The <a href="/topics/department-of-health-and-human-services/">Department of Health and Human Services</a> on Tuesday announced $1.8 million in aid to Guatemalan health authorities to fight sexual disease and improve research with human subjects.</p><p>An announcement such as this might have gone unnoticed, but federal lawyers filed legal papers the day before asking for the dismissal of a lawsuit seeking to hold the <a href="/topics/us-government/">U.S. government</a> and its public-health officials accountable for the outcomes of Tuskegee-style medical experiments conducted on more than 1,000 Guatemalans in the late 1940s.</p><p>In those post-World War II experiments, U.S. public-health officials intentionally infected prisoners, psychiatric patients and soldiers with syphilis, gonorrhea and/or chancroid without their informed consent for study and treatment purposes. Many Guatemalans, however, were left untreated.</p><p>Lawyers for the Guatemalan victims said the $1.8 million in aid for <a href="/topics/guatemala/">Guatemala</a> is a positive action.</p><p>But the <a href="/topics/department-of-justice/">Department of Justice</a> papers filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia on Jan. 9 are an “extremely disappointing” response, given the harms done by U.S. officials to these victims and their families, said <a href="/topics/terrence-collingsworth/">Terrence Collingsworth</a>, partner at Conrad &amp; Scherer.</p><p>“It’s almost as if there’s a blockade that protects the <a href="/topics/us-government/">government</a> with immunity, and when you stack the statutes together … it’s like it’s an impermeable wall,” said Conrad &amp; Scherer attorney <a href="/topics/piper-hendricks/">Piper Hendricks</a>.</p><p>But she said she is “seeing some chinks in that armor,” adding that she and her colleagues would be filing briefs by March 9 before U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton.</p><p>In the <a href="/topics/department-of-justice/">Justice Department</a> court filings, Tony West, assistant attorney general, and his co-counsel wrote, “As a result of these unethical studies, a terrible wrong has occurred.” But while the United States “is committed to taking appropriate steps to address that wrong,” they wrote, “this lawsuit is not the proper vehicle - and this Court is not the proper forum - through which the consequences of this shameful conduct may be resolved.”</p><p>The <a href="/topics/department-of-justice/">Justice Department</a> asked that current federal office-holders be dismissed from the case, and cited the Federal Tort Claims Act as a primary basis for immunity for the United States. Lawyers for Mirta Roses Periago, director of the Pan-American Health Organization, also asked the court to “dismiss this case with prejudice” because she and the organization “are indisputably immune from this action.”</p><p>The <a href="/topics/guatemala/">Guatemala</a> case was the subject of a September 2011 report, “Ethically Impossible: STD Research in <a href="/topics/guatemala/">Guatemala</a> From 1946 to 1948,” conducted by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues. The case has been described as Tuskegee-style because of its similarities to the infamous Alabama experiments in which black men with syphilis saw doctors but were never told about their syphilis or given treatment for it.</p><p class="pagination mb"/><p class="small">© Copyright 2012 The Washington Times, LLC. <a href="http://license.icopyright.net/3.7280?icx_id=/news/2012/jan/10/hhs-offers-aid-over-guatemalan-std-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="item-license">Click here for reprint permission.</a></p><p class="left full pl bb bt br bl mr"/></div></div></body></html>
