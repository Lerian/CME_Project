                                <p>Gloomy readers, take heed. There may be a reason why you rolled out bed this morning with a proverbial black cloud looming overhead. </p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It's Blue Monday, an ill-reputed date that has been dubbed "the most depressing day of the year." </p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The theory stretches back to 2005 when psychologist Cliff Arnall was asked to figure out the most miserable day of the year. </p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Using an elaborate math formula, he came up with the third Monday in January – as if Mondays weren't demonized enough already. </p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Arnall reasoned that Blue Monday is the day when a slew of unpleasant variables such as drab weather, failing New Year's resolutions and Christmas bills collide, creating a veritable maelstrom of negativity. </p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>"Motivational levels also tend to be quite low at this time of year," Arnall told CTV's Canada AM last Blue Monday. </p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>"You've got something called the 'hibernation effect,' when people tend to be more lethargic, they eat more than they really need."</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There are some questions, however, about whether Arnall's theory is actually valid. </p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Arnall was asked to whip up his formula for a public relations firm as part of a marketing campaign for travel company, Sky Travel. What better reason to go on vacation than to lessen the effects of the "most depressing day of the year?"</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Psychiatry lecturer Dean Burnett is one of many critics who have dismissed Arnall's equation as ludicrous. In particular, he takes issue with the theory's liberal use of the word "depressing."</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>"True clinical depression (as opposed to a post-Christmas slump) is a far more complex condition that is affected by many factors, chronic and temporary, internal and external," he wrote in an editorial for the <i>Guardian</i>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Even Arnall, the harbinger of doom himself, has conceded that his theory is not particularly helpful. </p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>While he still stands behind his Blue Monday formula, Arnall told London's <i>Telegraph </i>newspaper two years ago that the date has become a "self-fulfilling prophecy." </p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Instead of dwelling on the date, he urged people to focus on happiness year round. </p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>"I'm pleased about the impact it if it means people are talking about depression…but I'm also encouraging people to refute the whole notion of there being a most depressing day and to use the day as a springboard for the things that really matter in your life," he told the paper. </p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Still, many continue to latch onto the idea of Blue Monday. </p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This year, it didn't take long for the topic "Blue Monday" to trend on Twitter, landing only a few spots below #HappyMLKday -- a tag honouring Martin Luther King Jr., the famed civil rights activist who makes headlines on the third Monday of January for entirely different reasons. </p>

</p><p><b>Joe</b><br/>Blue Monday is not only Junk Science but A state of Mind attitude.Keep focused on the present moment and "All is Well"<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><b>MJ, ON</b><br/>Definitely mind over matter.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><b>Tom Hanna</b><br/>I kind of like dwelling on that little chicken I use to watch as a child, "the sky is falling, the sky is falling", now that's depressing!<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><b>Matt in NB</b><br/>I feel great !  Monday yet?<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><b>Ron</b><br/>Beat the Blues-Selfless Service, go out there and help some<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><b>PBW</b><br/>As with anything to do with statistics - a branch of maths - you can prove anything to suit your own ends.  It's Monday after a weekend off work - live with it.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><b>David J</b><br/>By the third Monday the days are getting longer, and anyone suffering from Seasonal Depression will start noticing an improvement in their mood. The rest of the junk science explanation -- Christmas bills, etc -- is self-inflicted, and doesn't apply to everyone.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><b>Will</b><br/>Crap no matter how you look at it.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><b>manic monday</b><br/>I get bummed out on sunday just thinking about Monday.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><b>island girl</b><br/>To say something is depressing doesn't imply a state of depression. The scientist who beefed that is confusing verbs and nouns. Anyway, I am in the dumps this morning and now I find it was predestined. I feel better.....<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><b>Dano</b><br/>There's only 1 Jan 16th 2012 in our life time, let's make it a great one.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><b>JB in Ontario</b><br/>Getting some exercise I think would help those people who feel lethargic.  Some jumping jacks might help, or some push-ups!<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><b>LisaLearyGertz</b><br/>How can it be Blue Monday when it's a holiday from work?  Sorry, I believe Blue Monday belongs in the dregs of March....<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><b>Colin</b><br/>Every Monday is the most depressing day of the year. <br/><br/></p><hr/><p><b>Liss</b><br/>Everyone's got a point on this article. Just remember - the theory, junk or not, applies to us a whole. You as an individual will probably have a crappier day than today this year (or perhaps it's already passed), and maybe it will be your happiest day of the year. I say try to make the best of it, regardless of external circumstances.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><b>panda</b><br/>this humoured me.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><b>Prof. Pye Chartt</b><br/>"Blue Monday" appears to be scientifically valid.  CTV's story concerning PM Harper's comments about the Canadian economy roused an unusually high number of bitter and angry anti-Conservatives this morning.<br/><br/></p><hr/><p><b>One Earth, One World</b><br/>Arnall forgot one major fact: it might be winter in the Northern Hemisphere, but it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and, therefore, it cold be the least depressing day in cities such as Sydney, Auckland, Santiago, Buenos Aires, and CapeTown. Geography is a very important element in all "hypotheses" and "theories", and cannot be dismissed on the basis of who commissioned or sponsored the "study".<br/><br/></p><hr/>
