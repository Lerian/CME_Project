  A BASINGSTOKE man has pleaded not guilty to infecting two women with the HIV virus.
</p>
<p>
  Henry Assumang, 33, of Coppice Pale, Chineham, denied two counts of inflicting grievous bodily harm at Winchester Crown Court this morning.
</p>
<p>
  It is alleged that Assumang, who is HIV positive, had sexual relationships with the two women after meeting them in Basingstoke between 2007 and 2010. The women cannot be identified for legal
  reasons.
</p>
<p>
  Assumang, who is originally from Ghana, spoke only to confirm his identity and to deny the two charges.
</p>
<p>
  Recorder Maria Lamb granted him bail. A trial will start on Monday, June 11, and is expected to last between five and seven days.
