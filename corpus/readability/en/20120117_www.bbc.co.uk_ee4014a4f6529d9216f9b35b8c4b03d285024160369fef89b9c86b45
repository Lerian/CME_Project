                      <p class="introduction">An outpatient is recovering from shock after being billed $44.8m (Â£29.2m) in error by a New York hospital.</p>&#13;
        <p>Alexis Rodriguez, 28, was one of a number of patients charged astronomical amounts because of a computer glitch, the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/44-million-bill-bronx-lebanon-hospital-article-1.1006744?localLinksEnabled=false">New York Daily News reports</a>.</p>&#13;
        <p>The Bronx-Lebanon Hospital treated him for pneumonia, but the actual cost was no more than $300.</p>&#13;
        <p>Billing firm PHY Services said it had mistakenly printed the patient invoice number where the amount should go.</p>&#13;
        <p>Mr Rodriguez told the New York Daily News he could not believe his eyes when he opened the envelope last week.</p>&#13;
        <p>"I think they should have somebody look over the bills before they send them out," said the unemployed doorman.</p>&#13;
        <p>"To send out a lot of bills with numbers that big - someone could have had a heart attack."</p>&#13;
        <p>PHY Services requested that patients ignore the bills, adding that new ones would be sent out.</p>&#13;
