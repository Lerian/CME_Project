                <p>A quarter of doctors take cash payments from drug or device makers and nearly two-thirds accept routine gifts of food, including lunch for staff members and dinner for themselves, according to analyses by the <em>New York Times</em> and others, including the <em>Business Journal</em> and its sister publications.</p>
<p>Now, the Obama administration is set to require drug companies to adopt stringent disclosure policies when they compensate doctors for everything from speaking, travel and entertainment to research and consulting, the <em>Times </em>said.</p>
<p>More than 1,100 drug, device and medical supply companies would have to file reports, the administration said in the report. That will create a large set of useful new data and allow federal officials to inspect and audit drug company records to make sure the reports were accurate and complete.</p>
