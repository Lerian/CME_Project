<p><font>The revelation on </font><a href="http://www.andersoncooper.com/episodes/headline-makers-the-one-man-sperm-bank-and-the-latest-author-phenom/" target="_blank"><font>Anderson Cooper's daytime show, Anderson</font></a><font><span>,</span> means that the self-confessed tech-geek, an expert in Silicon Valley, finds himself in the highly unusual position of never having had sex, but fathering 14 healthy offspring.</font><font><br/></font></p><p><font>Speaking on the chat show, Mr Arsenault said: 'I coined this term "donor sexual" and I'll explain it means 100 per cent of my sexual energy is for producing sperm for childless couples to have babies. So I don't have other activity outside of that.'</font></p><p>
</p><p class="relatedItemsTopBorder"> </p>
<p><font>An incredulous Mr Cooper asked: 'So you do not have sex?'</font><font><br/></font></p><p><font>'I will probably be the 40-year-old virgin,' the donor explained. 'Except I'll have 15 plus kids' - a statement that bought with it applause from the audience to the confusion of the host.</font></p><p class="clear"> </p><div class="thinCenter">

<p class="imageCaption">Slow clap: Anderson Cooper laughs in confusion as the audience applauded Mr Arsenault's virgin dad status<br/></p></div>
<p><font>The show saw the virgin dad meet one of his progeny for the first time as Analise, who turns two this week, walked onto the stage. </font><font><br/></font></p><p><font>A visibly emotional Mr Arsenault said the meeting was a 'a thrill.' The toddler is mothered by a lesbian couple who seemed overjoyed following the donor's decision to help them conceive.</font><font><br/></font></p><p><font>'I'm trying to not get too emotional,' he said. 'I’m just extremely happy that she's healthy and in a loving home. I hope she has the gene of compassion and that her parents nurture that.'</font></p><p class="clear"> </p><div class="thinCenter">

<p><font>Via a website, he touts his sperm as being organic but a health expert on the show warned that his unusual approach to fatherhood opens the door to spreading viral diseases such as HIV.</font></p><p><font>Her fears echo those of the FDA which claims Mr Arsenault did not take precautions to prevent disease spreading and found him to be </font><font>unlawfully manufacturing human cells.</font></p><p><font> The agency issued a 'cease-and-desist order' in what is the first ever case of its kind involving a private sperm donor in the U.S.</font><font><br/></font></p><p><font>Mr Arsenault said in the past that he is simply helping out childless couples in situation where the only other alternative would be sex with a stranger.</font><font><br/></font></p><p><font>He told Huffington Post: ‘I'm helping people in need... </font><font>I'm not running a business here.'</font></p><p><font><img src="http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.11NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzMjY3NDU*NjIxMzYmcHQ9MTMyNjc*NTQ2NzQ2NCZwPSZkPSZnPTImbz1iNmQxYzRlOTI1NDE*ZWE3OTg3YzU4Y2Ix/M2U4ODM2NCZvZj*w.gif" border="0"/><object name="kaltura_player_1326745461" id="kaltura_player_1326745461" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allownetworking="all" allowfullscreen="true" data="http://cdnapi.kaltura.com/index.php/kwidget/wid/0_s9fsmmla/uiconf_id/5397191"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><param name="allowNetworking" value="all"/><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"/><param name="movie" value="http://cdnapi.kaltura.com/index.php/kwidget/wid/0_s9fsmmla/uiconf_id/5397191"/><param name="flashVars" value=""/><a href="http://corp.kaltura.com">video platform</a><a href="http://corp.kaltura.com/video_platform/video_management">video management</a><a href="http://corp.kaltura.com/solutions/video_solution">video solutions</a><a href="http://corp.kaltura.com/video_platform/video_publishing">video player</a></object><br/></font></p><p/><p class="clear"> </p>
