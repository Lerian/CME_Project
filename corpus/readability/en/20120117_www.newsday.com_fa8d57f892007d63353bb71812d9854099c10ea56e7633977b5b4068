                              <p> Celebrity chef and <a href="/topics/Food_Network">Food Network</a> star Paula <a href="/topics/Paula_Deen">Deen</a> announced on the "<a href="/topics/Today_%28NBC_Program%29">Today</a>" show Tuesday morning that she was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes three years ago. </p>&#13;
                               <p><a href="/topics/Paula_Deen">Deen</a> said she kept quiet about her condition until she had advice to offer the public. She announced she has teamed up with drugmaker <a href="/topics/Novo_Nordisk">Novo Nordisk</a> to launch a program that aims to help people live with Type 2 diabetes and promote a Novo diabetes drug.</p>&#13;
                               <p>The program is called <a href="/topics/Diabetes">Diabetes</a> in a New Light and offers tips on food preparation, stress management and working with doctors on a treatment plan. Recipes and tips can be found at http://www.Diabetesinanewlight.com.</p>&#13;
                                             <p>"I wanted to bring something to the table when I came forward," she said Tuesday during an appearance on NBC's "<a href="/topics/Today_%28NBC_Program%29">Today</a>" show. "I've always been one to think that I bring hope." When asked if the high-fat, high-caloric recipes she champions can lead to diabetes, she hedged.</p>&#13;
                               <p>"That is part of the puzzle," she said, but mentioned other factors: genetics, lifestyle, stress and age.</p>&#13;
                               <p>"On my show I share with you all these yummy, fattening recipes, but I tell people, 'in moderation,"' she added. "I've always eaten in moderation." <a href="/topics/Paula_Deen">Deen</a> has Type 2 diabetes and takes Victoza, a once-daily noninsulin injection. The website links to promotional materials for the drug.</p>&#13;
                               <p>Type 2 is the most <a href="/topics/Common_%28musician%29">common</a> form of diabetes. In Type 2 diabetes, the body either does not produce enough insulin or does not use it efficiently, allowing excess sugar, or glucose, to accumulate in the blood.</p>&#13;
                               <p>The 64-year-old Deen, known as "the <a href="/topics/Queen_%28band%29">Queen</a> of Southern cuisine," appears on <a href="/topics/Food_Network">Food Network</a>.</p>&#13;
