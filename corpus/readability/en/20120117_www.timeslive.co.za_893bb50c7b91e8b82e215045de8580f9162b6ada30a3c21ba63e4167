            The SPCA says a man has been charged with animal cruelty after he allegedly neglected to care for his horses, resulting them in being put down in Vereeniging, Gauteng on Monday.</h3>
        <p>"The horses were underweight and had problematic hooves which caused severe pain and suffering," said Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals' Vereeniging manager Marlien Pieterse in a statement.</p>
<p>The owner had ignored warnings by the SPCA to get the two horses and a foal treated. The foal was born with a severely deformed mouth which caused severe pain whilst eating.</p>
<p>"The owner refused to hand the horses over to the SPCA and became verbally abusive towards our inspectors."</p>
<p>A warrant was obtained from the Vereeniging Magistrate's Court and the police called to help.</p>
<p>"All three equine had to be humanely destroyed under instruction of a veterinarian and equine specialist."</p>
<p>Pieterse said if the owner had treated the animals sooner, they would not have had to be put down.</p>
<p>The owner was expected to be prosecuted in terms of the Animals Protection Act.</p>
