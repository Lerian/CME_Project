															<p>An average of 230 Manitobans try to quit smoking every day. This week, their odds of quitting are better than ever.</p>&#13;
															
<p>It's National Non-Smoking Week and the Canadian Cancer Society has rolled out a new initiative called Break It Off to help young smokers kick the habit before they cause further damage to themselves.</p>&#13;
											    			&#13;
			&#13;
										
<p>"The big thing is the website, BreakItOff.ca," said CCS tobacco advocacy co-ordinator Will Cooke. "This was done in conjunction with Health Canada and is aimed at a younger demographic."</p>&#13;
															
<p>"Right now the highest smoking rate in Manitoba is among young people. We wanted to create a tool that is relevant to that age group."</p>&#13;
															
<p>Break It Off aims to get smokers to view their relationship with cigarettes as extremely unhealthy and encourages them to "break up" with their addiction.</p>&#13;
															
<p>"There are a lot of cool features young adults can use on the site," Cooke said. "You can even end your relationship with smoking publicly with a status update on Facebook."</p>&#13;
															
<p>According to the Canadian Cancer Society, a "public breakup" with smoking can greatly increase the chances of success.</p>&#13;
															
<p>"People successfully quit smoking in many ways and we have all sorts of tools to help them improve their chance of success," said Cooke in a media release. "It's all about helping people quit and improving their odds of staying tobacco-free."</p>&#13;
															
<p>The CCS also offers their Smokers' Helpline to help all Manitobans cope with the difficulties in quitting smoking.</p>&#13;
															
<p>"Medication like Champix can help, but another thing that helps people quit is getting telephone counselling," said Cooke.</p>&#13;
															
<p>Manitoba continues to have one of the highest smoking rates in Canada with about one in five Manitobans lighting up.</p>&#13;
															
<p>Benefits of butting out worth the effort</p>&#13;
															
<p>According to the Canadian Cancer Society, smokers feel pretty lousy after their initial 'breakup' with cigarettes. But here are the benefits you can expect after:</p>&#13;
															
<p>Eight hours: Increased oxygen in your system and lower blood pressure may have you feeling like a heavy weight is being lifted.</p>&#13;
															
<p>One day: Your lungs should be working better, leaving you out of breath a lot less often.</p>&#13;
															
<p>Two days: Your sense of taste and smell should be making a pleasant return.</p>&#13;
															
<p>One week: Increased blood flow to your hands and feet should have you feeling a lot less cold.</p>&#13;
															
<p>Four weeks: As your lung function continues to improve, physical activity should be quite a bit easier.</p>&#13;
															
<p>Six weeks: You should notice less coughing, sinus congestion and shortness of breath.</p>&#13;
															
<p>One year: Your risk of coronary heart disease is about half that of an average smoker.</p>&#13;
															
<p>Three years: Your risk of heart attack is similar to someone who has never smoked.</p>&#13;
															
<p>Five years: You have reduced your risk of getting cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, bladder, kidney and pancreas.</p>&#13;
