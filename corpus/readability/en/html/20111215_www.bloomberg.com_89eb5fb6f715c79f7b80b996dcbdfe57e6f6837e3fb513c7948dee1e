            <p>A bottle of Glenfiddich malt whisky
produced to honor the oldest living Scot sold at auction today
in Edinburgh for 46,850 pounds ($72,632), a European record. </p>
<p>The 55-year-old Scotch, sold by <a href="http://www.bonhams.com/eur/auction/18953/" title="Open Web Site" rel="external" density="sparse">Bonhams</a> in the Scottish
capital today, was one of 15 bottles of Glenfiddich Janet Sheed
Roberts Reserve, according to the auction catalog. The whisky,
which was put into casks in 1955 and bottled last month, had a
guide price of between 30,000 and 35,000 pounds with all
proceeds from the sale going to Water Aid. </p>
<p>“It’s not often a whisky of this stature comes up at
auction,” Martin Green, the whisky specialist at Bonhams, said
before the sale. “The rarity and quality of the liquid, the
exquisite bespoke packaging and the story behind its creation
makes this a collectible that’s hard to value.” </p>
<p>Janet Sheed Roberts is <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/scotland/" density="full">Scotland</a>’s oldest living person, at
110 years old. She lives next to the <a href="http://www.glenfiddich.co.uk/lda.html?redirect=/index.html" title="Open Web Site" rel="external" density="full">Glenfiddich distillery</a> in
the Scottish Highlands and is part of the Grant family that
founded the whisky producer, according to Bonhams. Various
whiskies have been sold previously to mark her recent birthdays. </p>
<p>A bottle from the Glenfiddich distillery, with whisky
matured for 64 years, sold for 25,200 pounds at Bonhams in
Edinburgh on June 16, 2010. That price compared at the time with
a world record of 29,400 pounds for a bottle of Scotch set in
Glasgow in 2007. It was since surpassed in a sale in <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/new-york/" density="sparse">New York</a>.
The prices include the auctioneer’s fee. </p>
<p>The Glenfiddich sold today in Edinburgh was bought by an
unidentified Internet bidder. Offers started at 22,000 pounds
and the hammer price was 38,000 pounds. </p>
