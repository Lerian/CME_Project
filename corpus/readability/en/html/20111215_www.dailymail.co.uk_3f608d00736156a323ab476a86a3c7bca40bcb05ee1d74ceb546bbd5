<p class="imageCaption">Mr Right? Men leaving nail clippings out is one of the top turn-offs<br/></p></div><p><font> Ladies searching for Mr Right, look away now. The ‘perfect man’, it seems, does not exist.</font></p><p><font>While many chaps have positive attributes, the majority are deeply flawed.</font></p><p><font>In fact, in a study of 2,000 women, most ranked their partner as only 69 per cent perfect.</font></p><p><font>Included in a list of 20 common shortfalls are failing to make an effort with their partner’s friends, criticising their driving and the inability to multi-task.</font></p><p><font>Other male failings include leaving the toilet door open, watching too much sport and poor personal grooming.</font></p><p><font>Nikki McReynolds, marketing director for Remington, which commissioned the study, said: ‘It seems women are quite realistic on what they look for from their partner.</font></p><p><font>‘While they might happily overlook a few common flaws, there are certain behaviours that men just won’t get away with.’ <br/></font></p><p><font>The research found a third of women 
will turn a blind eye to their man watching too much sport – as long as 
they listen to them when it counts. </font></p><div class="thinCenter">

<p><font>But one in five women is convinced 
her mischievous partner only pretends to listen to them, while others 
believe it’s ‘in one ear and out the other’. <br/></font></p><p><font>Thankfully, one in five 
would forgive leaving the toilet seat up, while the leniency also 
stretches to those who don’t help with the cooking. </font></p>
<p><font>A quarter of women said dodgy dancing
was forgivable, but bugbears such as clothes being left on the bedroom 
floor and snoring can count against men. <br/>
</font></p>
<p><font>And guys beware: Leaving the toilet 
dirty, not making an effort with their partner’s family and using her 
toothbrush are definitely big no-nos. </font></p>
<p><font>Leaving out nail clippings, growing a
scruffy beard or being too much of a mummy’s boy are other sure fire 
ways to guarantee ‘imperfection’. <br/></font></p><p>

<p><font>When asked what would make the perfect man, a good personality came top, followed by a sense of humour and looks.</font></p>
<p><font>Miss McReynolds said: ‘The average guy
may not be able to compete with the image of a David Beckham, but there
are still a number of small changes they can do to make a big 
difference.’</font></p>
