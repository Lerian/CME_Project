			Aspirin benefits not as high as previously thought.</p>
			<p><span>Researchers have questioned the benefits of aspirin to stave off heart attack or stroke in people without a history of cardiovascular disease.<br/> <br/> Aspirin may not have the same level of positive effect previously thought, given the associated risk of internal bleeding, when trying to prevent heart attack or stroke, according to a study at St George's University of London.<br/> <br/> The drug has been widely used to reduce the risk of clots forming in blood vessels, which lead to heart disease and stroke.<br/> <br/> However, according to the study, clinicians have failed to assess the relative benefit of aspirin in relation to the possible side effects for people without a history of cardiovascular disease.<br/> <br/> Dr Sharlin Ahmed, research liaison officer at the Stroke Association, commented: "People who think that taking aspirin on a regular basis as a precaution without advice from their doctor should be aware of the potential harm they could be causing themselves."<br/> <br/> However, those who have specifically been told to take aspirin following a cardiovascular episode should continue to do so, according to Dr Ahmed.<br/> <br/> An alternative preventative treatment to aspirin has not yet been discovered, despite studies trying to develop such a drug to limit side effects.<br/> <br/> Find the nearest Barchester <a href="http://www.barchester.com/" target="_blank">care home</a>.<img alt="ADNFCR-504-ID-801261755-ADNFCR" src="http://feeds.directnews.co.uk/feedtrack/justcopyright.gif?feedid=504&amp;itemid=801261755"/></span></p>
