                      <p class="introduction" id="story_continues_1">The new surgeon appointed in the Isle of Man after a controversy over the the future of breast care services has been revealed.</p>&#13;
        <p>Millie Bello will start at Noble's Hospital in February.</p>&#13;
        <p>Her appointment comes after concerns about replacing a specialised breast surgeon with a general surgeon.</p>&#13;
        <p>A government spokesperson said Ms Bello had more than 10 years' experience as consultant general surgeon with a special interest in breast surgery.</p>&#13;
        <p>Ms Bello said she was looking forward to working with colleagues to ensure patients received "the highest standard of care possible".</p>&#13;
        <p>Chief Executive of Manx Cancer Help, Andrea Chambers said: "Ms Bello is a highly-regarded breast surgeon and her appointment is a coup for the Isle of Man."</p>&#13;
