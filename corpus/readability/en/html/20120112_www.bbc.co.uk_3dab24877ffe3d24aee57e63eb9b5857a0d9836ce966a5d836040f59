                      <p class="introduction" id="story_continues_1">New mums should be advised that it is normal for their baby to cry more if they are breastfed, say experts.</p>&#13;
        <p>The Medical Research Council team says this irritability is natural, and although formula-fed babies may appear more content and be easier to pacify, breast is still best.</p>&#13;
        <p>If parents have more realistic expectations more may stick with breastfeeding, they hope. </p>&#13;
        <p>Most UK mums try to breastfeed. Within months the rate drops to a third.</p>&#13;
        <p>The Department of Health recommends that mothers exclusively breastfeed for the first six months after birth.</p>&#13;
        <p>The most common reason given for women to stop breastfeeding is that "Breast milk alone didn't satisfy my baby", which the MRC scientists say reflects their perception of irritability as a negative signal. </p>&#13;
        <p>But they say this crankiness in babies is normal and just their natural way of communicating their needs to their mother and is no cause for alarm. </p>&#13;

		</div>      <p id="story_continues_2">For example, some cries will be down to tiredness not hunger.</p>&#13;
        <p>And the reason formula babies are so serene could well be because they are overfed. </p>&#13;
        <p>Lead investigator Dr Ken Ong said: "Bottle-fed babies may appear more content, but research suggests that these infants may be overnourished and gain weight too quickly. </p>&#13;
        <p>"Our findings are essentially similar to other stages of life; people often find that eating is comforting."</p>&#13;
        <p>In their study, they asked more than 300 mums to comment on the temperament of their own baby and to state whether they were using breast or bottle. </p>&#13;
        <p>Overall, 137 of the infants were exclusively breastfed, 88 were exclusively bottle-fed, and 91 were fed with a mixture of formula and breast milk. </p>&#13;
        <p>Breastfed babies were deemed to have "more challenging temperaments" and tended to cry more.</p>&#13;
        <p>Rosie Dodds, of the National Childbirth Trust, said the new observations were useful for parents. </p>&#13;
        <p>"Mothers and babies may experience starting to breastfeed as demanding or stressful in this society where bottle-feeding is seen as the norm and breastfeeding is unfamiliar to many new parents.</p>&#13;
        <p>"It would be interesting to compare this with countries where almost all babies are breastfed. </p>&#13;
        <p>"We often hear from mothers who say that once both they and their baby got the hang of it, breastfeeding was a breeze."</p>&#13;
