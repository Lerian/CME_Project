<p>Robin Gibb has flown in a team of alternative medics from Switzerland to help him fight liver cancer.</p>&#13;
<p>The Bee Gees star has undergone seven rounds of chemotherapy in his bid to beat the disease and he is now receiving 24-hour care from naturopath nutritionists - which are thought to be the idea of his wife Dwina - at his home in Thame, Oxfordshire.</p>&#13;
<p>As well as the naturopathic approach - which relies on the body's ability to heal itself through good nutrition, rather than relying on surgery and drugs - Dwina has encouraged the singer to have 20-minute detox sessions.</p>&#13;
<p>A close family friend told the British <i>The Sun</i> newspaper: "Robin is fighting this with dignity and courage. He's trying everything possible to beat this disease."</p>&#13;
<p>In November 2011, Robin - who is a teetotal vegan - revealed details on his battle with liver cancer, which was diagnosed in April.</p>&#13;
<p>At the time, he said: "I have been very unwell and am now on the road to recovery, and your prayers and wishes are a great tonic to me. I believe because of you I will get well and my deepest love goes out to you all."</p>&#13;
<p>The diagnosis came as a massive blow to Robin after he thought "everything had gone back to normal" following his successful treatment for an intestinal blockage in 2010.</p>&#13;
<p>Speaking of the ordeal, he explained: "All this time I'd thought it was wind cramps. But the surgeon said that was typical of the way it manifests. The blockage was so bad that he was surprised it hadn't burst the day before, but it was too dangerous to delay any longer.</p>&#13;
<p>"The relief was enormous, and afterwards I needed no painkillers. Not even an aspirin. I have a vegetarian diet, and a great appetite. Everything seemed to go back to normal."</p>
