</p><p class="storycopy">In trials of the drug, patients have lost at least half a stone (7lb). One apparently shed up to four stone after taking the treatment.</p>                     <p class="storycopy">Injections of the hormone can also cut blood pressure and cholesterol levels.</p>                     <p class="storycopy">One obesity expert hailed the ground-breaking findings as ­potentially revolutionary.</p>                     <p class="storycopy">Doctors already use it to treat diabetics. The hormone, called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), is secreted from the intestine when we eat and is the bodys natural way of ­suppressing appetite.</p>                     <p class="storycopy">People taking it feel less hungry and it is already used in Britain to treat type 2 diabetes because of its ability to regulate blood sugar levels.</p>                     <p class="storycopy">Dr David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said: These new injections really have the potential for revolutionising treatment. Safety-wise they are pretty good. I am using them on my patients and have had a lot of ­success. For some they have been dramatically successful, with one losing about four stone and having blood sugar under control for the first time ever.</p>
