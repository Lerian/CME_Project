<p>The giveaway begins today (11 January) and comes ahead of a new expected TV campaign by Leo Burnett, which rolls out in February.</p>
<p>McDonald's has secured a deal with book publisher HarperCollins, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, to give away millions of copies of Morpurgo's 'Mudpuddle Farm' childrenâ€™s books with Happy Meal purchases.</p>
<p>Murpugo is the author of 'War Horse', which has been made into a film by Steven Spielberg and launches in cinemas this weekend.</p>
<p>The McDonald's campaign is supported by the National Literary Trust, as well as Jade Goody's ex-boyfriend Jeff Brazier, who is acting as an ambassador for the campaign.</p>
<p>In total, six titles from HarperCollin's 'Mudpuddle Farm' range will be made available during the promotion.</p>
<p>The move could come in for criticism from some quarters, who will argue McDonald's is offering sweeteners for parents and children to buy Happy Meals.</p>
<p>Jonathan Douglas, director of the National Literacy Trust, said: "We are very supportive of McDonald's decision to give families access to popular books, as its size and scale will be a huge leap towards encouraging more families to read together."</p>
