<br/><span class="Apple-style-span">"</span><span class="Apple-style-span">The lady that works for my surgeon rang me quite late at night, it was about ten o'clock when I got the call," former glamour model Lauren tells the show. "Her phone number came up on my phone and I thought, 'Oh God, it's not going to be good news'.Â </span></p>&#13;
	<p>
<span class="Apple-style-span"><br/>"She said, 'Just to let you know, you have got those implants, the English government aren't saying you have to have them out yet, but the French are'. Because I hadn't really paid attention, I didn't know whether it was really bad, and so straight away my gut feeling was like, 'Oh my God, I'm going to have to have another boob job!'"</span></p>&#13;
