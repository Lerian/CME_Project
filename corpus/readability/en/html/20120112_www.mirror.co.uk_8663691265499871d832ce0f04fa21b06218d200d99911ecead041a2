	<p>A mum accidentally saved her own life by coughing up a cancer tumour – and was congratulated by a doctor on her good fortune.</p>&#13;
	<p>Claire Osborn, 37, felt a tickle in her throat seconds before she hacked up a 2cm wide heart-shaped lump into a tissue. </p>&#13;
	<p>She took the growth to her doctor and a biopsy revealed it was an aggressive throat cancer. The mum of six was initially given a 50% chance of survival. But further tests revealed there was no trace of any other cancer.</p>&#13;

	<p>Doctors believe the tumour grew on a stalk at the back of her throat and the coughing dislodged it.</p>&#13;
	<p>Claire said: “The consultant said: ‘It appears you have coughed up your cancer. Congratulations.’ I was totally flabbergasted, a coughing fit had saved my life.”</p>&#13;
	<p>Claire felt a scratching sensation in her throat on October 11 last year and after five minutes’ coughing, she felt “something dislodge” and fly out of her mouth.</p>&#13;
	<p>She said: “It looked like a strip of liver. I threw it away. The next day the same thing happened but this time the lump was much bigger. I knew something was very wrong so I went straight to my GP who sent the tissue sample away for tests.”</p>&#13;
	<p>Claire and husband Kevin, 53, of Coventry, went on holiday and medics confirmed the sample was malignant on their return.</p>&#13;
	<p>She said: “I was devastated. I just thought I was going to die so I started saving for my funeral.”</p>&#13;
	<p>But a scan at University Hospital Coventry came back negative. She needed only a minor operation to remove cancerous tongue cells.</p>&#13;
	<p>Her surgeon Gary Walton said: “It is very uncommon to cough up cancer, but she did it.”</p>&#13;
