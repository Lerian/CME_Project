"There are a wide range of treatments available for addiction, from 
  taking drugs like Prozac to treat the symptoms and cravings, to cognitive 
  behavioural therapy, through to psychotherapy where they talk about 
  underlying problems. 
</p>
<p>
"There is no evidence to show that one treatment is better than any 
  other, and most people will take a multimodal approach."

<strong>Signs that you may be addicted: </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong><i>Losing track of time</i></strong>: Hours can fly by without your realising 
  because you are so absorbed in the activity. If a plan to spend a few 
  minutes on the internet regularly turns into hours you may have a problem. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><i>Irritability when interrupted</i></strong>: If you regularly get cranky if 
  you are interrupted online it could be a sign you are spending too much time 
  on the internet. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><i>Feelings of guilt:</i></strong> If you feel guilty about the amount of time 
  you spend online or if you often find your partner or family nagging you 
  about the time wasted it is possible you have an addiction. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><i>Isolation from family and friends:</i></strong> Is your social life suffering 
  because of the amount of time online? Losing touch with friends and family 
  is a sign that you are becoming addicted to the internet. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><i>A sense of euphoria when online and panic when offline</i></strong>: If you 
  feel euphoric or only calm when you are online while you feel anxious and 
  cut off when offline there is a chance you could be spending too much time 
  at the computer 
</p>
<p>
<strong><i>Dry eyes, aches, weight gain or sleep disturbances:</i></strong> Any physical 
  changes as a result of spending too much time online are obvious signs that 
  something is wrong. 
</p>

<strong>Tips for breaking an internet addiction:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Ask yourself, “<strong><i>What am I missing out on when I spend so much time 
  on the Internet?</i></strong>” Write down these activities and decrease your 
  Internet time to pursue some of them. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><i>Set reasonable Internet use goals and stick to them</i></strong>. Take 
  frequent breaks, at least 5 minutes each hour, and do some other activity. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><i>Alter your routine</i></strong> to break your usage patterns. If you spend 
  evenings on the Internet, start limiting your use to mornings. 
</p>
<p>
Seek out friends and acquaintances who “couldn’t care less” about the 
  Internet. <strong><i>Take time to appreciate the fact that all life is not yet 
  online.</i></strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong><i>Stay connected to the offline world</i></strong>. Visit newsstands, book and 
  music stores, and participate in entertainment such as museums, music, and 
  live theatre. Novels and poetry readings are hard to experience online. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><i>Treat the Internet as a tool. </i></strong>Stay focused on the fact that the 
  Internet is a means to an end. Plan your strategy—whether you’re looking for 
  information or entertainment—with the end in mind and you’ll save valuable 
  time.
