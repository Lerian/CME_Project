Its Happy Meals, which cost about £2.20, have come under fire in the past for 
  encouraging 'pester power'. Alongside a burger or chicken nuggets, chips and 
  a drink children are given a toy, usually tied in to the latest cinema 
  release.

McDonald's started to include bags of fruit after accusations that the Happy 
  Meals were unhealthy. 
</p>
<p>
At the end of last year an American woman filed a lawsuit in California 
  alleging that McDonald's was luring in her daughter through its distribution 
  of free toys.

Literacy campaigners said it did not matter if McDonald's decision was 
  prompted by a desire to improve its image. Eight out of ten all families 
  with young children visit the fast-food company at least once over the 
  course of the year, so there was a strong chance they would end up with a 
  book. 
</p>
<p>
Jonathan Douglas, director of The National Literacy Trust, said: “Our recent 
  research showed that one in three children in this country don’t own a book, 
  which is extremely concerning as there is a clear link between book 
  ownership and children's future success in life. We are very supportive of 
  McDonald’s decision to give families access to popular books, as its size 
  and scale will be a huge leap towards encouraging more families to read 
  together.”

<p>
The McDonald’s Happy Meal book promotion will include six titles from the 
  Mudpuddle Farm range: Mossop’s Last Chance; Albertine, Goose Queen; Pigs 
  Might Fly!; Jigger’s Day Off; Martians at Mudpuddle Farm; Mum’s the Word.
