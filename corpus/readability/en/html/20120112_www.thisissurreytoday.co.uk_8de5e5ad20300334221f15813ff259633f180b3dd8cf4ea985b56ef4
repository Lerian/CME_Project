			<p>DOCTORS are urging those who have made a new year resolution to quit smoking to get the help they need.</p>&#13;

						</div><p>In addition to the Quit Kit, the NHS Smokefree website also features a "Quit App" for iPhones and a cost calculator, allowing smokers to see exactly how much their habit is costing them.</p>&#13;
				<p>Dr Ruth Charlton, joint medical director at Epsom and St Helier NHS Trust, said: "Making a serious commitment to quit smoking is one of the best single things people can do, not only for their health but for that of the people around them.</p>&#13;
				<p>"It almost goes without saying that the other obvious benefit from quitting is that it's a good move financially.</p>&#13;
				<p>"Over the course of ten years, a person smoking 20 cigarettes a day will see something in the region of £25,000 go up in smoke, quite literally."</p>&#13;
