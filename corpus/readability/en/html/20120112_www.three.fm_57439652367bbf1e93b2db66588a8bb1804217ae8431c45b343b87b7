&#13;
<p>Noble’s Hospital’s new breast surgeon was unveiled today by the Department of Health.</p>&#13;
	<p>&#13;
</p><p>Ms Millie Bello will take up her post as the Island’s new consultant general surgeon with a special interest in oncoplastic breast surgery and care.  </p>&#13;
<p><br/>&#13;
	</p>&#13;
<p>She will officially begin her role on February 1 when she will head up the multi-disciplinary breast care service.</p>&#13;
<p> </p>&#13;
<p>Minister for Health, David Anderson said this marked the start of a new era of breast care in the Isle of Man (see audio).</p>&#13;
<p><br/>&#13;
	</p>&#13;
<p>He said: "This appointment marks an exciting development for the Island’s breast care service. On-Island breast care is now not only secure for the long-term, with a permanent consultant in post, but can also now be developed further in line with the Department’s three-phase plan to enhance breast care services for the people of the Isle of Man.”</p>&#13;
<p> </p>&#13;
<p>Ms Bello and her team will be charged with taking forward the DoH’s plans to offer a wider range of enhanced services on-Island, providing those who develop breast cancer with an exceptional standard of care.  </p>&#13;
<p><br/>&#13;
	</p>&#13;
<p>These services will include the provision of oncoplastic breast surgery, sentinel node biopsy, immediate and delayed breast reconstruction, symmetrisation surgery and aesthetic breast reconstruction.</p>&#13;
<p> </p>&#13;
<p>Ms Bello said: "I am very excited about coming to the Isle of Man.  I’ve already made a number of visits and the Island offers an excellent quality of life.  </p>&#13;
<p><br/>&#13;
	</p>&#13;
<p>"The community seems very friendly and I’ve already been made to feel welcome.  I’m very much looking forward to working with colleagues to develop the Island’s breast care service, ensuring that patients receive the highest standard of care possible.”</p>&#13;
