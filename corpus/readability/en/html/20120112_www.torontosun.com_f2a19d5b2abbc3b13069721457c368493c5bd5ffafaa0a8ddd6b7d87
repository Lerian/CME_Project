	<p>A Stouffville man is charged with not telling his sexual partners that he’s infected with HIV.</p>&#13;
<p>York police said they received an anonymous tip in June about the suspect, accusing him of not disclosing his medical condition prior to having sex with women.</p>&#13;
<p>Police said they identified a victim by October and that allowed them to build a case alleging that he had sexual relations without disclosing he is HIV-positive.</p>&#13;
<p>The suspect was arrested without incident on Tuesday.</p>&#13;
<p>Now investigators want to know if there are other victims who haven’t come forward.</p>&#13;
<p>Anyone with information is asked to call the Sexual Assault Unit at 1-866-876-5423, ext. 7071.</p>&#13;
<p>Sarbjit Singh Mann, 39, is charged with aggravated sexual assault and criminal negligence.</p>&#13;
