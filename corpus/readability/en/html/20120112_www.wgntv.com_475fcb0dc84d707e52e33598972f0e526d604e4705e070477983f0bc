                    Walgreen's on Tuesday is slated to open a two-story flagship store on State Street in the Loop that will offer more than aspirin and batteries.
</p><p>
The store at State and Randolph will offer manicures and eyebrow shaping, made-to-order sushi, a juice and smoothie bar, self-serve frozen yogurt and even a humidor. The new Walgreen's will also offer a clinic and an upscale cosmetics department. It will also sell wine, alcohol and fresh food.
</p><p>
The store is marking its return to the State and Randolph intersection where it had run a store from 1926 until 2005.
</p><p>
The grand opening ceremony will be today from 4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.
