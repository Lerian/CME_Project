										<p>DEMOLITION work began Wednesday at the Misericordia Health Complex, the start of a $43-million development.</p>&#13;
															<p>A 2,272-kilogram wrecking ball was used to cave in the roof of a 106-year-old building, the Maryland South building.</p>&#13;
															<p>The redevelopment will take place in two phases.</p>&#13;
															<p>Phase one involves replacing the demolished Maryland South building with a two-storey complex that will accommodate the Buhler Eye Centre -- the largest facility of its kind in Western Canada -- and the new University of Manitoba Ophthalmology residency program.</p>&#13;
															<p>The complex's ambulatory diagnostic centre will relocate from the fourth floor to be closer to Urgent Care and Ambulatory Care.</p>&#13;
															<p>The new complex will house PRIME, a new day health centre for the elderly.</p>&#13;
															<p>Work in the first phase is expected to be completed in 2013.</p>&#13;
															<p>The second phase of the redevelopment will include demolition of the Sherbrook building and replacing it with a new chapel and spacious front entrance and two-storey glass-walled atrium</p>&#13;
															<p>Wednesday's demolition was unexpectedly interrupted when the wrecking ball became wedged in the upper floors of the structure and came loose.</p>&#13;
															<p>Hospital officials said the wrecking ball was reattached and demolition crews were back to work by noon.</p>&#13;
															<p>George Vincent, project superintendent, said it will take about seven weeks to completely demolish the building and clean up the site.</p>&#13;
