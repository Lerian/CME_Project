<p>The female representative in the National Youth Council (NYC) governing council, Adama Njie, has revealed that the estimates from the joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNIAIDS) has indicated that close to 33.3 million are people living with HIV-AIDS and most of them are living in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>She said it also estimates that close to one third of all HIV/AIDS infected persons are young people who are between the ages of 15 and 24 years. Adama Njie made these remarks recently during a two-day workshop on HIV/AIDS, drug and alcohol use among youths. The worshop was held at the President's International Award Sheme in Bakau.</p>
<p>Gambia's national HIV/AIDS prevalence rate, she disclosed is 1.6 percent of the adult population. Among the key priorities of the government of The Gambia, she indicated is to make the country a drug-free nation. "The use of both formal and traditional mechanism to curb drugs, alcohol and substance abuse is highly desirable," Madam Njie noted.</p>
<p>She went on: "I strongly believe that our approaches should be comprehensive, universal and to focus on the key drives of vulnerability of the young. We should focus on programmes that ensure the protection of young people and enhance their capacity and to participate in shaping their future".</p>
