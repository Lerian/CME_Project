Thousands of bottles of Sterimar Isotonic spray have been recalled after two batches were found to be contaminated with the bacteria Pseudomonas stutzeri and Sphingomonas paucimobilis.

A statement on the MHRA website said if consumers "exhibit any of the symptoms...then they should consult a healthcare professional."
