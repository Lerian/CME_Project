She made the announcement yesterday in a release for her new <a href="http://www.diabetesinanewlight.com/" target="_blank">Diabetes in a New Light</a> website and products.</p>
<p>This morning on <a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/?_r=1" target="_blank"><em>Today</em></a>, the Food Network star admitted to Al Roker she learned of her diagnosis during a routine check-up three years ago but decided not to take that news public until she could “bring something to the table when I came forward.”</p>
<p>Deen, whose menu has been <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20526407,00.html">criticized by other celebrity chefs</a> for being unhealthy, insisted to Roker that she always encouraged moderation when it comes to diet, including her own.</p>

<p>Is the sad news that Deen has diabetes complicated in your mind by the fact that she’s now a paid spokesperson for a pharmaceutical company? Did she have any responsibility to share the news of her illness with her loyal foodies sooner?</p>
