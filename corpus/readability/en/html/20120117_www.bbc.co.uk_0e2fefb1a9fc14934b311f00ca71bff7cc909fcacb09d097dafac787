                      <p class="introduction" id="story_continues_1">A reduction in training places for nurses in London is "deeply concerning", the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has warned.</p>&#13;
        <p>NHS London is cutting the number of trainee nurses from 2,000 to 1,580 a year.</p>&#13;
        <p>The organisation claims the change will allow it to raise standards of teaching.</p>&#13;
        <p>But the RCN warned of the possibility of "chronic shortages" of nurses, with staff poached from abroad.</p>&#13;
        <p>RCN chief executive Dr Peter Carter said: "We are deeply concerned at this reduction in nurse training places. </p>&#13;
        <p>"The nursing workforce has grown in recent years, but only just enough to keep up with rising demands on healthcare. </p>&#13;
        <p>"It is vital to avoid a return to the chronic shortages of the early 1990s and the old boom-and-bust cycle of NHS workforce planning."</p>&#13;
  <span class="cross-head">'Wasted investment'</span>&#13;
	      <p>He continued: "NHS London needs to produce a robust plan guaranteeing continued investment in nurse training and education.  </p>&#13;
        <p>"The vast majority of newly qualified nurses are dedicated professionals, who are committed to providing the highest possible standards of patient care. </p>&#13;
        <p>"Having the right numbers and mix of healthcare professionals is pivotal in enabling these nurses to provide this high quality care."</p>&#13;
        <p>Dr Anne Rainsberry of NHS London said: "Figures show that if we continue to train the same number of adult nurses as we currently do, there will soon be more trained nurses than there are jobs available.  </p>&#13;
        <p>"This would leave graduates out of work and waste the taxpayers' investment in their training.</p>&#13;
        <p>"By reducing the number of training places for adult nurses next year, we can invest in training more nurses where London really needs them - like increasing the number of health visitors and children's nurses working in the capital."</p>&#13;
