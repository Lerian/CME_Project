                      <p class="introduction" id="story_continues_1">Mass gatherings, such as the London 2012 Olympics, can be a hotbed of diseases from across the world, public health experts have warned.</p>&#13;
        <p>They say it can have consequences for the host nation and for people when they return to their own countries. </p>&#13;
        <p>There are also important issues to consider in handling large numbers of people, they say.</p>&#13;
        <p>A series of reports, <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/series/mass-gatherings">in The Lancet Infectious Disease journal</a>, has been highlighting the risks.</p>&#13;
        <p>The theory is that so many people, packed closely together, increases the risk of diseases spreading.</p>&#13;
        <p>Prof Ibrahim Abubakar, from the University of East Anglia, writes that there are risks from diseases already in the host country and from the home countries of the visitors.</p>&#13;
        <p>He highlighted religious or music festivals and major sporting events as mass gatherings which could have a public health risk, such as an <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/16/5/09-1136_article.htm">influenza outbreak during World Youth Day in 2008</a> in Australia.</p>&#13;
        <p>One report said increased air travel and the spread of diseases could have "potentially serious implications to health, security, and economic activity worldwide".</p>&#13;

	      <p id="story_continues_2">The reports also highlight the challenges of managing large numbers of people and pointed to the <a href="/news/world-europe-10751899" title="German festival stampede kills 19">stampede at the 2010 Love Parade in Germany</a> in which 21 people died and 500 were injured.</p>&#13;
        <p>Saudi Arabia has to make careful preparations for the world's largest annual mass gathering - the Hajj, with more than two million pilgrims. </p>&#13;
        <p>Prof Ziad Memish, from the country's Ministry of Health, said: "Conventional concepts of disease and crowd control do not adequately address the complexity of mass gatherings.</p>&#13;

        <p>Prof Brian McCloskey, who is in charge of the Health Protection Agency's preparations for London 2012, told the BBC: "The history of the Olympic Games suggests infection doesn't happen often.</p>&#13;
        <p>"The issue for us is to make sure the right system is in place to respond."</p>&#13;
        <p>He has been improving the agency's disease surveillance to include data straight from hospitals and walk-in centres, which he said would "leave a legacy of probably the most comprehensive disease surveillance system in the world".</p>&#13;
