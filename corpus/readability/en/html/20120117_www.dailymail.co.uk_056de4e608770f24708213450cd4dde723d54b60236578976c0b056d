<p><font>It's enough to send a shiver down the spine of any pneumonia victim.</font></p><p><font>When unemployed New York doorman Alexis Rodriguez was handed his medical bill after three weeks in hospital, he must have felt ill.</font></p><p><font>The 28-year-old knew his </font><font>Bronx-Lebanon Hospital bill would </font><font> be big, but $44 million?</font></p><p class="clear"> </p><div class="thinCenter">

<p><font>'I almost had an asthma attack,' Mr Rodriguez told the New York Daily News.</font></p><p><font>Thankfully, he was not alone. Mr </font><font>Rodriguez was just one of several hundred patients to receive absurdly inflated bills because of a 'system error'.</font></p><p><font>The amount he owed was $44,776,587 for outpatient services that in reality amounted to no more than $300.</font></p><p>
</p><p class="relatedItemsTopBorder"> </p>
<p><font>Mr Rodriguez panicked at first because he had spent three weeks in the hospital with pneumonia in the spring and knew he had to pay part of the $40,000 cost.</font></p><p><font>But he quickly realised the terrifying invoice couldn’t be right. He called the billing company and found out he wasn’t the only one with sticker shock.</font></p><p><font>The billing firm, PHY Services, said it was a simple mistake: The subcontractor that prints the bills put the invoice number into the 'amount due' field.</font></p><p><font>The company has apparently been deluged with complaints and said it would be sending out an apology.<br/></font></p><p><font>A recording for callers says: 'If you are calling with respect to a billing statement for services provided at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, please disregard the statement. You will be receiving a new statement shortly. '</font></p><p><font>Mr Rodriguez said that even though no harm was done to his bottom line, the sloppiness surprised him.</font></p><p><font>'It was a big error,' he said. 'I think they should have somebody look over the bills before they send them out.'</font></p><p><font>Hospital spokesman Errol Schneer said he didn’t blame Mr Rodriguez for being upset.</font></p><p><font>'We certainly share any concerns he would have,' he said.</font></p><p><font> </font></p><p class="clear"> </p>
