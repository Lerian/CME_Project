<p><font>The third Monday of January is allegedly the most depressing day of the year - when we forget our good intentions for a healthy diet and exercise and wallow on the couch in a cloud of self-pity while bemoaning the miserable weather. <br/></font></p><p><font>However it has been suggested that the whole concept is based on junk science drummed up by a travel company as a clever ploy to have us booking holidays to sunnier climes. <br/></font></p><p><font>According to psychologist Cliff Arnall, today is when most people are at their lowest ebb, a scientific formula he came up with based on the length of time until next Christmas, holiday debt and the likelihood of giving up New Year's resolutions. </font><br/></p><p class="clear"> </p><div class="thinCenter">

<p><font>Mr Arnall, who is a tutor at Cardiff 
University in Wales, wrote about 'Blue Monday' six years ago - in a 
press release for Sky Travel, a now defunct British TV travel channel. <br/></font></p><p><font>He based the theory on the 'hibernation' effect - a time of year when people feel tired, don't exercise, stay indoors and eat comfort food</font><font>.<br/></font></p><p>
</p><p class="relatedItemsTopBorder"> </p>
<p><font>However </font><font>psychiatrist Dean Burnet told the Guardian: '</font><font>True clinical depression (as opposed to a
post-Christmas slump), is a far more complex condition that is affected
by many factors, chronic and temporary, internal and external.'</font></p><p><font>However Mr Arnall was standing behind his theory, even telling a radio station this morning that today should be called 'Red Monday' as it is potentially the most depressing day ever.</font></p><p class="clear"> </p><div class="thinCenter">

<p><font>In an interview with BBC Good Morning Scotland: 'It is the combination of factors that make life right now particularly uncertain. There is threat of job redundancy and the cost of food and fuel are going up.'</font></p><p><font>In another past press release by Mr Arnall, this time for ice-cream company Wall's, he claimed that the 'happiest' day of the year was June 23 - based on a formula of </font><font> outdoor activity, high energy levels and amount of sunlight. </font><br/></p><p class="clear"> </p><p class="clear"> </p><div class="thinCenter">
