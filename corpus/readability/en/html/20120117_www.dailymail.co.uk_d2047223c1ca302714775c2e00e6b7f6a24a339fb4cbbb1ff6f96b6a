<p><font>Serious accidents involving pedestrians wearing headphones while using electronic devices such as iPods have tripled, warn researchers.</font></p><p><font>They found a dramatic rise in injuries to people using headphones while walking in the street, particularly among young men.</font></p><p><font>There is increasing concern about the near trance-like state people can apparently enter while using mobile phones, MP3 players or electronic personal organisers. <br/></font></p><p><font>Psychologists call this ‘divided attention’ or ‘inattentional blindness’ and it has become a focus for road safety campaigners.</font></p><p><font> A U.S. study shows the number of people suffering serious injury while using headphones tripled in six years.</font></p><p><font>The research, published in the Injury Prevention journal, analysed U.S. data from 2004 to last year on injuries to pedestrians using headphones.</font></p><p><font> Cases involving mobile phones, including hands-free, or cyclists were excluded.</font></p><p><font>During the study period, there were a total of 116 reports of death or injury, jumping from 16 in 2004/5 to 47 in 2010/11. <br/></font></p><p><font>Eighty-one of the 116 collisions – 70 per cent – resulted in the person dying. In a quarter of cases a warning – such as a horn or siren – was sounded before the crash.</font></p><p><font>Two out of three victims were men and under the age of 30, with around one in ten of all cases under the age of 18. <br/></font></p><p>
</p><p class="relatedItemsTopBorder"> </p>
<p><font>Nine out of ten cases occurred in urban areas and more than half of the victims were struck by trains.</font></p><p><font>The data used in the analysis was from the U.S. National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Google news archives and a university research database.</font></p><p class="clear"> </p><div class="thinCenter">

<p><font>Study leader Dr Richard Lichenstein, of the University of Maryland Hospital for Children in Baltimore, said: ‘The use of headphones may pose a safety risk to pedestrians, especially in environments with moving vehicles.’</font></p><p><font>Previous studies have shown people wearing headphones or talking on a mobile phone respond less to external stimuli, such as sounds and traffic when crossing the street. <br/></font></p><p><font>Andrew Howard, head of road safety at the AA, said: ‘Pedestrians and cyclists seem to get lost in a private cocoon when they’re on a mobile in the street, or wearing headphones.</font></p><p><font>‘Precise figures don’t appear to be available here. There are many close calls. You’ve only got to look around to see it’s on the rise.’</font></p>
