	<p>Ms Wheaton said she watched her son get increasingly ill.</p><p>"He was white as a ghost and I knew straight away something was wrong," she told the inquest as she fought back tears.</p><p>Only a short time earlier she had waited up to 15 minutes to get a doctor after her son's lips had turned blue.</p><p>He had also vomited over his grandmother who had flown into Sydney from New Zealand.</p><p>"He was turning his head from side to side like he was having a nightmare," Ms Wheaton said.</p><p>"He was still. He wasn't moving. He was getting cold."</p><p>Ms Wheaton told the inquest that she had not been told of the risks of the treatment used on Tama, who was given a Maori name meaning boy.</p><p>Tama's father and Ms Wheaton held hands during the inquest, which continues before deputy state coroner Scott Mitchell.
