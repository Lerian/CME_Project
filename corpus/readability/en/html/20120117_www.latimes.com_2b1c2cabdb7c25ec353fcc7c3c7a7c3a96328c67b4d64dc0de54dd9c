                                        Exposure to alcohol during gestation can cause a range of </p><a class="taxInlineTagLink" id="HEISY000097" title="Birth Defects" href="/topic/health/physical-conditions/birth-defects-HEISY000097.topic">birth defects</a><p>. But now scientists have drawn up a chronology of when the damage occurs.
</p><p>
In a study published Monday researchers collected confidential data on drinking patterns -- the timing, frequency and quantity -- from 992 California women during their pregnancies. Following </p><a class="taxInlineTagLink" id="HEPHC0000048" title="Pregnancy and Childbirth" href="/topic/health/physical-conditions/pregnancy-childbirth-HEPHC0000048.topic">childbirth</a><p>, the babies were examined for signs of alcohol exposure, such as below-average height or weight and some head and facial characteristics, including a small head circumference or a flattening of the cleft between the nose and upper lip.

                                        The strongest associations were found during the second half of the first trimester. For every one-drink increase in the average number of drinks consumed daily there were sizable increases (ranging from 12% to 25%) in the risk of physical abnormalities related to fetal alcohol syndrome.
</p><p>
But researchers found various results among women who had similar drinking patterns, showing that there is no single threshold that triggers fetal alcohol syndrome.
</p><p>
While the most significant link to damage was found in weeks seven through 12 of pregnancy, that doesn't mean it's safe to drink earlier or later, the authors said. Some women who drink heavily in early pregnancy have miscarriages, which were not counted in this study.
</p><p>
The study also found specific abnormalities linked to drinking in the second trimester. In the third trimester, only birth length was linked to drinking patterns.

"Based on our findings, there is no safe threshold for alcohol consumption during pregnancy with respect to selected alcohol-related physical features," the authors wrote. Pregnant women and women planning on becoming pregnant should abstain from alcohol, they said.
