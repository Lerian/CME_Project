		<p>Trent Arsenault <a href="http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/cease-and-desist-warning-issued-to-sperm-donor/story-e6frfku0-1226226363548">hit the headlines last December</a> when his free sperm bank came under investigation from the US Food and Drug Administration, which threatened him with a $100,000 fine and up to a year in jail.</p><p>Now, the Fremont, California local who bills himself as having an ideal gene pool to father children, has revealed that he is a 36-year-old virgin.</p><p>The revelation on CNN host Anderson Cooper's daytime show, <em>Anderson</em>, means that the self-confessed tech-geek, an expert in Silicon Valley, finds himself in the highly unusual position of never having had sex, but fathering 14 healthy offspring.</p>

	<p>Speaking on the chat show, Mr Arsenault said: "I coined this term 'donor sexual' and I'll explain it means 100 per cent of my sexual energy is for producing sperm for childless couples to have babies. So I don't have other activity outside of that."</p><p>An incredulous Mr Cooper asked: "So you do not have sex?"</p><p>"I will probably be the 40-year-old virgin," the donor explained. "Except I'll have 15 plus kids" - a statement that drew applause from the audience, to the confusion of the host.</p><p>The show saw the virgin dad meet one of his progeny for the first time as Analise, who turns two this week, walked onto the stage.</p><p>A visibly emotional Mr Arsenault said the meeting was a "a thrill". The toddler is mothered by a lesbian couple who seemed overjoyed following the donor's decision to help them conceive.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2087522/Organic-sperm-donor-fathered-14-children-admits-36-year-old-VIRGIN.html">Read more about the 36-year-old virgin dad at the <em>Daily Mail.</em></a></p>
