                                <p/><p>The NHS is facing a “neurology timebomb” as the number of people with conditions such as Parkinson’s and motor neurone disease (MND) increases, experts have said.</p>&#13;
                    			&#13;
                                <p>New figures from Parkinson’s UK show there will be 28 per cent more people with Parkinson’s disease by 2020. </p><p>At present about 127,000 people have the disease – which affects actor Michael J Fox and boxing legend Muhammad Ali – but this figure is expected to reach 162,000 by 2020.</p><p>The number suffering from MND is also set to rise by 27 per cent in the same period.</p><p>At present 50 people are also newly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) every week.</p><div id="1.2060026" class="left"><img src="/webimage/1.2060026!image/3520191301.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_215/3520191301.jpg"/></div><p>The Neurological Alliance, which represents more than 70 charities and organisations, yesterday said a neurology timebomb would catch the NHS unawares unless urgent action was  taken. It also accused the Westminister government of having its “head in the sand”.</p><p>The alliance argues that services are being run in a “haphazard way” with no clear strategy in place, and billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money is potentially being wasted.</p><p>It follows a damning report in December from the National Audit Office (NAO) which found emergency hospital admissions for people with neurological conditions have risen by almost a third despite a huge government investment in services.</p><p>The study said while access to services had improved and waiting times had fallen, key areas of care had got worse.</p><p>In 2009-10, 14 per cent of people with Parkinson’s disease, MS and MND who were discharged from hospital after an overnight stay were readmitted within 28 days as an emergency.</p><p>People admitted as an emergency are also often treated by doctors and nurses with no neurological training, with evidence suggesting this worsens outcomes for patients.</p><p>Furthermore, the report found delays in diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>Steve Ford, chairman of the Neurological Alliance and chief executive of Parkinson’s UK, said: “The situation can only get worse. A crisis is looming but the government has its head in the sand.”</p><p>He added: “When it comes to helping vulnerable people with a neurological condition the government is floundering around in a fog of its own making. We need a leader to champion improvements – a neurology tsar, if you like – backed up with a plan and a strategy.</p><p>“When diabetes, cancer and stroke were assigned tsars, things really started to happen.</p><p>“People affected by neurological conditions are fed up with being at the bottom of the government’s ‘to do’ list.”</p><p>Mr Ford will give evidence to the Commons public accounts committee today in light of the NAO report.</p><p>Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the MS Society, added: “The government now needs to send a clear message to everyone living with a neurological condition that these services are a  priority.”</p><p>The estimated number of people who have MND in the UK is 4,200, but this is predicted to rise to 5,330 by 2020.</p><p>Around 100,000 people in the UK have MS.</p><p>A Scottish Government spokesman said: “Our top priority for people living with all neurological conditions is to ensure the Neurological Standards published by Healthcare Improvement Scotland are implemented – they offer the best mechanism for achieving safe, effective and person-centred care.</p><p>“The standards will help ensure people get the earliest and most appropriate treatment locally, but with access to specialist services when needed. That’s why we’ve provided boards with £1.2 million, to help take the standards forward.”</p>                &#13;

                            <p>LAST week, at the family home in Uddingston, Jimmy Johnstone received bad news. For the past four years the man voted Celtic's greatest-ever player, a Lisbon Lion who in 1967 was part of the first British side to hold aloft the European Cup, had faced a challenge greater and more exhausting than cracking any defence he faced on the football fields of Scotland and Europe.</p>&#13;
