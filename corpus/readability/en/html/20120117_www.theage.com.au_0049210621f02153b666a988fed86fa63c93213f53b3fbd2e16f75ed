            <p>RESEARCHERS have found that a growing number of people are reporting caffeine toxicity from energy drinks in Australia, especially teenagers.</p>

            <p>According to a study published in <em>The Medical Journal of Australia</em>, nearly 300 calls were made to the  New South Wales poisons centre regarding adverse reactions to energy drinks between January 2004 and the end of 2010, with more than a third of people attending hospital.</p>

            <p>The authors say the report is a ''warning call'' for health authorities to better educate the public on the risks associated with high-energy drinks, and require beverages to display health warnings similar to those found on over-the-counter caffeine tablets.</p>

            <p>For the study, Naren Gunja, a medical director and toxicologist at the NSW Poisons Information Centre, and Jared Brown, a  senior poisons specialist, reviewed all the centre's calls relating to toxicity of high-energy drinks  covering the seven-year period.</p>

            <p>Calls regarding caffeinated energy drinks increased from 12 in 2004 to 65 in 2010, with recreational use the most common type of exposure.</p>

            <p>Adverse reactions and toxicity from the beverages are primarily linked to caffeine.</p>

            <p>Caffeine toxicity can mimic amphetamine poisoning, cause seizures, psychosis, cardiac arrhythmias and rarely even death, but the most common symptoms reported include irregular heart rate, tremors, stomach upsets and dizziness.</p>

            <p>Teenagers were the most common age group affected, and energy drinks were often consumed with other stimulants, mainly alcohol.</p>

            <p>Red Bull and V accounted for almost two-thirds of the energy drink-related cases referred to the centre, followed by Mother and Pulse.</p>
