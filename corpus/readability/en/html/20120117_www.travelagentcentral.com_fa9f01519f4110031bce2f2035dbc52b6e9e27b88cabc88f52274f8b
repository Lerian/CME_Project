Except for the elderly, young children or those with severe medical issues, the virus usually is harmless. Over the past few years, cruise lines have a well-established protocol for dealing with cases of noro-virus onboard ships.</p><p>Health groups, such as the <strong>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</strong> and <strong>Britain</strong>'s <strong>Health Protection Agency</strong>, generally encourage ports to offer support to vessels arriving with ill people. In addition, only 74 passengers and crew (about two percent of those on board) had been reported ill; that's below the three percent level the CDC considers as an outbreak. The Falklands' chief medical officer made the decision after consulting with a U.K. microbiologist. </p><p>"An outbreak in the Falkland Islands would put enormous pressure on our limited medical resources, and jeopardize other scheduled cruise visits,” a government statement said. Politically speaking, <strong>Argentina</strong> and the U.K. – long adversaries for control of the remote islands off the coast of <a href="http://www.travelagentcentral.com/central-south-america" target="_blank"><strong>South America</strong></a> – are in the midst of a diplomatic row. Argentina calls the Falklands by a different name, the <strong>Malvinas</strong>. The two countries went briefly to war over the islands in 1982, with the British maintaining control. Now, <a href="http://www.travelagentcentral.com/other-brazil/brazils-hidden-gem" target="_blank"><strong>Brazil</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.travelagentcentral.com/chilean-wine-country/wine-tours-chile" target="_blank"><strong>Chile</strong></a> and <strong>Uruguay</strong> are supporting Argentina by turning away ships flying the Falklands flag. Apparently many citizens of those countries were passengers on <i>Star Princess. </i> Today, January 17, <em>Star Princess </em>calls in <a href="http://www.travelagentcentral.com/buenos-aires/buenos-aires-0" target="_blank"><strong>Buenos Aires</strong></a>, Argentina. The 14-day cruise ends Jan. 21. </p><p>Visit <a href="http://www.princess.com" target="_blank">www.princess.com</a></p>                        &#13;
