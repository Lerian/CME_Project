	<p><strong>Paula Deen</strong>'s ready to talk, y'all.</p>&#13;
<p>The celebrity chef plans to set the record straight regarding dogged rumors that she has type 2 diabetes in a <a href="http://bites.today.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/01/13/10150344-paula-deen-to-discuss-health-rumors-on-today-tuesday" target="_blank">TODAY Show</a> interview with <strong>Al Roker </strong>next Tuesday.

<p>An April 2010<em> National Enquirer </em>story first alleging the diagnosis resurfaced on Friday, when <a href="http://www.thedaily.com/page/2012/01/13/011312-gossip-paula-deen-1-2/" target="_blank">The Daily</a> reported that Deen plans to confirm the news -- and that she's signed on to be the spokeswoman for a Novartis drug that treats the disease.</p>&#13;
