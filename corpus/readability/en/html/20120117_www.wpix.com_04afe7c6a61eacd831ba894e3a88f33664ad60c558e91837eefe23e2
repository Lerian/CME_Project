                                        Alex Rodriquez, of the Bronx, keeps an inhaler for emergencies and last week, he needed it.<br/>
<br/>
The 28-year-old unemployed, ex-doorman says doctors at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital cured him of pneumonia.  But last week when he received a bill in the mail for the hospital's services, he felt ill again.<br/>
<br/>
										
                                        
                                        
                                        "I almost had an asthma attack," Rodriquez told PIX 11 News. The bill was for $44,776,587.<br/>
<br/>
"When i saw 44 million, I thought it had to be a mistake," said Rodriquez.<br/>
<br/>
Alex said he is unemployed and doesn't have insurance so he expected a hefty bill. The hospital estimated he would have to pay $40,000 in installments and the first bill was only supposed to be for a couple of hundred.<br/>
<br/>
"The union took away my insurance then I got sick," he said.<br/>
<br/>
When he saw the bill, he immediately called the billing firm, PHY services, and got an automated message that said the invoice was a mistake.  And that the computer accidentally swapped the invoice number with the "amount due."<br/>
<br/>
Rodriquez spoke with a customer representative who said they had received hundreds of calls. PHY services told him they would send a new bill and an apology letter.<br/>
<br/>
"People make mistakes, system errors, computer errors. Someone should check the bill," said Rodriquez.
